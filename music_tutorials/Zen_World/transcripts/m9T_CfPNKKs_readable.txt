================================================================================

[00:00] yo what's up ninjas we've been making some sick sounds but we've been lacking

[00:05] a bit of dynamics and a bit of change well today that's gonna change because

[00:09] we're gonna be learning about envelopes which is gonna allow us to make punchy

[00:12] basses, pads, lush leads and sounds that move that change over time. In Serum 2

[00:20] envelope 1 is routed to the volume by default and I think volume is one of

[00:23] the best ways to learn the ADSR system that most envelopes are gonna use so my

[00:29] next volume is gonna be decided by the main volume and the levels inside each

[00:34] oscillator they're all gonna be controlled by this envelope 1 so for

[00:38] example at the moment if we increase the attack of the sound the sound will

[00:43] gradually come in and that's because the attack controls the first part of an

[00:50] envelope which is how long it takes for us to reach the max value which with

[00:56] this envelope we can't really move or change okay so that's gonna be decided

[01:00] by wherever everything your levels are set. Something to note here is that I can

[01:04] also play with the slope of this very important because if I want to dial in

[01:09] the sound more and with how I envision it slope is gonna allow us to gradually

[01:17] go in or slowly come up and then all of a sudden get to that desired loudness

[01:22] which can be useful for brassy sounds. To the right of that we have a hold which

[01:26] we're gonna come back to after we go through decay sustain and release. Now

[01:30] decay is gonna control once the attack phase is over we're at the max amplitude

[01:35] decay controls how long it takes for us to go from that max amplitude to our

[01:39] sustain okay and our sustain is the value in this instance the volume what

[01:44] we're gonna stay at as a MIDI note is held after the attack and decay phase

[01:49] have passed and then I move it down volumes coming down I'm still holding

[01:54] the note you can see that here I go up mid but sustain I can lower it down to

[01:59] around let's say 75% of the way down and now decay when we move it you're gonna

[02:05] hear what it does okay so decay controls value coming from that max amplitude to

[02:15] the sustain however decay is also very useful for pretty much I'm adding

[02:20] perceived punch to a sound okay from there we have our release which is gonna

[02:27] control the fade out of the sound after I let go of the note so right now I'm

[02:31] stuck in sustain because I'm holding down the note but once I let go the

[02:36] release kicks in and that release decides how long the sound lingers for

[02:39] before it reaches back to quiet no sound or a value of zero change hold what it's

[02:45] gonna do is it's gonna hold after the attack phase it's gonna hold max

[02:50] amplitude for however much time you set now the way this is useful is let's say

[02:55] that I have a sound or I'm creating a sound for future rave or melodic techno

[02:59] where I want to lead that's gonna be very staccato okay now I can definitely

[03:05] program a lead that's staccato without the hold with a high sustain the problem

[03:10] with that is as a sound designer I've noticed some people need a bit of

[03:12] guidance and I need to make it easy for them to use the sound as intended okay

[03:17] so with the hold I can have it be so that when someone presses the note even

[03:21] for a long time the hold limits that so now play and I make it super punchy now

[03:36] there's a couple of things that we can do here number one we can change the

[03:39] value or the the time right sec milliseconds to 1 8th 1 4th 16th if you

[03:47] like that system a lot better which I can find use for that whenever I'm

[03:50] trying to create an effect let's say I want the effect to come up for a bar and

[03:55] then I want it to go down for two bars which might be useful for something like

[04:00] creating a noise swell and there we go you know goes up a bar and goes down for

[04:07] two bars so that's where it might be useful the other thing too is if you

[04:10] notice here if I increase the decay I cannot see what's happening after that

[04:14] so here I have by pulling up a zoom out feature and by pulling down I zoom in

[04:18] okay and I also have a lock feature which locked itself automatically zoom

[04:22] in for me which is good and bad the reason I say good and bad is because

[04:25] sometimes I'll do this and I'm like yep that that definitely looks like how a

[04:29] pad should be shaped and then I'll play it and the sound doesn't last how it

[04:33] should so that's the only drawback of that so sometimes I just like to zoom

[04:37] out like this and then do this envelope one is routed to the volume so what else

[04:42] can you route envelopes to the most common common common common things that

[04:47] they would add envelopes to are the filter cutoff to create plucks so here

[04:54] I'm going to use envelope 2 and open up the cutoff and lower down the sustain

[04:59] and use the decay to get the punch now let's talk a little bit about what's

[05:03] going on here so you can understand and now you know not in the volume but more

[05:06] about value of moving knobs so by clicking here and dragging I can drag

[05:10] this to any knob you can see there's a plus wherever I can drag it somewhere

[05:15] okay now from there this blue line appears and this blue line is gonna tell

[05:19] us the modulation amount how much do we want to change whatever knob we're on in

[05:24] this scenario how much do we want to open up the cutoff by okay so that's

[05:28] what that blue line does now in terms of the envelope the way you want to see it

[05:31] is change if we increase the attack right an envelope one that that is

[05:35] deciding how long it takes for us to increase the volume to max volume max

[05:40] amplitude in this scenario it's how long it takes for us to go from this side of

[05:43] the knob to the at the end of the blue line so if I wanted to create a wub I

[05:48] would add attack play low then I will use a square

[06:00] kind of there right if you know you know and if you don't enjoy your youth

[06:03] okay so from there a little bit of resonant right we can create sounds like

[06:09] this the other thing is lower the attack back down you know we have this you know

[06:14] an odd mobby sound so here decay is controlling how long it takes for us to

[06:18] go from that end of the blue line back to the original value where the cutoffs

[06:22] at because the sustain is all the way down if the sustain is somewhere in the

[06:25] middle it's gonna linger in the middle now why is this useful here well I'm

[06:31] gonna show you guys why let's say you're making a bass line you're like okay I

[06:35] want to punch you so you pull it down you do this you move this here you go

[06:39] this and you're holding it down but now when you hold it down let's say you're

[06:42] in a song and there's drums the issue here now is is that you can't really

[06:46] hear the bass I mean you can feel the sub right so this is where you might

[06:50] decide to hold the note bring your sustain up you're like okay the bass is

[06:54] fat there and if it was stayed here we should be able to hear it and feel it so

[07:00] now when I play it notice when I increase the release here nothing really

[07:07] happens and the reason for that is because the release in an envelope it's

[07:11] only gonna matter if there's sound to begin with right so if our envelope one

[07:15] the volume there's no volume because we let go and there's no release and you're

[07:18] gonna hear it but if I add the release now you can hear the release kicking in

[07:26] on this the second place that most analog synths allow you to route an

[07:34] envelope to remember the limitations they've set and what most of them have

[07:38] in common is the pitch and there's a lot of techniques here to deal with the

[07:43] pitch okay the first thing is if I go to a sign I can use an envelope and route

[07:46] it here and then I can lower down the sustain to create lasers okay now notice

[07:55] that when I put this on there this line is going left and right it's not going

[08:02] in one direction well that's because we are in bipolar mode now and Serum is

[08:06] gonna decide whether it's in bipolar mode or unipolar mode depending on what

[08:09] you put it on and what the value of that knob or the pitch is so to change that

[08:14] let's you just want to go up and back to the original pitch you're gonna hold

[08:17] option or alt shift click on that blue little knob and you make it unipolar you

[08:23] can also go into the matrix and you're gonna see here polarity and then you're

[08:26] gonna highlight this and bipolar off but if we turn it on now it goes in both

[08:30] directions again and we can also click there to turn it back to a unipolar one

[08:35] now this pitch knob the cool thing about it is one we can create essentially

[08:39] downlifters like so let's put some detunement okay we can create effects

[08:49] like this add a bit of attack this is gonna make it so that the pitch slowly

[08:53] goes up again and then it comes down

[08:57] like very iconic the other thing too is if we go to the right really fast lower

[09:02] the decay we can add like a like almost like a snap on top of the sound use a

[09:11] triangle sounds fucking great I like for creating these kind of create 808 or

[09:20] knocky bass lines this way add a bit of release let's use the distortion here

[09:29] and now boom slam that thing okay the other thing too now is we can also go

[09:37] the other way which gives us a essentially like a

[09:43] hello Chris Slate add a bit of attack

[09:52] right we could do a lot of really cool stuff we can add that to wubs and and

[09:57] so forth okay the other thing we can do this for is check it we can add it to

[10:01] the octave range here and you get that and then the cool thing about serum 2

[10:13] now is that when you highlight and move it now it tells you where you're going

[10:17] from to what and I love that because back then it wouldn't tell you so you

[10:20] would have to just dial it in by ear and by eye now from there with envelopes the

[10:26] best way to learn them and the best way to learn anything when you learn is to

[10:30] make some sounds so why don't we make a couple of sounds so that you guys can

[10:34] see the workflow on how to use them okay so the first one we can make is a bass

[10:39] so let's make a very really nice stack bass okay so what we're gonna do is go

[10:44] minus 2 on this first oscillator which is gonna be our sub layer or our lower

[10:48] layer for the bass we're gonna go with a square a very common sub oscillator to

[10:52] use for more moggy and aggressive bass lines on the top I'm gonna add a saw

[10:58] minus 1 one octave above this one we're gonna random phase it for now and now

[11:05] we're gonna use a filter out both for them and pull the cutoff back now if you

[11:09] want some tips here from experience to make a good bass that's gonna sound good

[11:14] what I like to do is I'll play this and I'll set the cutoff point by ear where I

[11:19] still hear the bass how I would want it heard when sustained and then I'm gonna

[11:24] use an envelope now to open it up to a certain amount I'm gonna lower down the

[11:30] sustain and there we go a little higher up now the level matters I want where

[11:41] the saw is influencing the bass more than the square but the square is still

[11:44] providing that low-end body the identity of this bass will come from how much you

[11:52] open up by the decay you set, sustain, the resonance

[12:14] and there we go

[12:21] let's add a bit of key track pull it back more and also add the envelope to the

[12:30] resonance if you wanted to now we can make that saw be a seventh let's lower

[12:40] the DB pull we already know what all that does let's change the square to a

[12:55] saw let's get our values right here because you're gonna see the values will

[13:00] really dictate how alive punchy this bass is let's also make sure we have

[13:06] saws that match well together we're gonna use the same one so they don't

[13:10] phase out

[13:13] is that some reverb from Ableton?

[13:35] And notice that the bass, I'm doing it but you don't really feel too much of the punch

[13:41] even though we have stuff going on.

[13:43] And that's because we also have to optimize the volume, right?

[13:46] The envelope can shape the sound with the frequency removal in addition, bringing it

[13:50] back with an envelope, but we also want to play with the volume a bit.

[13:54] Now a key thing here is don't do this because you thin it out too much, but you do want

[13:58] some form of reducement in volume, but not too much.

[14:02] I'm going to add a hint of release just to help whenever I play too staccato-ish.

[14:29] Okay, now the other type of bass I can make is also keep it simple.

[14:35] Here I can increase the resonance to create a very housey bass.

[14:44] Make it a wub by increasing the attack, I'm going to increase the sustain here on this

[14:47] guy.

[14:55] Now let's get creative, let's add a saw, an octave up with detunement.

[15:08] So again, you can do all of that with the basic shapes, in fact, I would make a case

[15:11] that with the basic shapes, if you're making a rolling bass for instance, you know, the

[15:16] important thing is that envelope.

[15:17] Super important because it's going to dictate how your bass sounds.

[15:20] So I'm just going to put an arp here so that it rolls.

[15:24] I'm going to put this at 128 BPM.

[15:30] Okay, now I'm going to play to create a rolling bass.

[15:35] I'm going to also do a shift 12, we'll talk about this once we get to this section, but

[15:38] I'm just doing it to kind of show you a little bit more on the envelope side of stuff.

[15:44] Okay, very important that you set this right, your volume too.

[15:48] Now watch, if I make this too long, bass is fine, right, but it's a little muffled.

[15:53] Here, you feel it more.

[15:55] Switch it to a square.

[15:59] Right, this one maybe you might want a little bit more decay.

[16:03] There you go.

[16:06] Increase this.

[16:10] Maybe this goes more down, so that the bass doesn't sound too fat and muffled.

[16:18] Okay, super cool.

[16:19] We can make that and then from there add another saw here.

[16:25] I'm going to retrig this.

[16:30] I'm going to use a high pass here on this guy, like this.

[16:39] Okay, from there let's make a super saw lead that's very trancey flowy.

[16:43] So we're just going to use eight saws.

[16:45] We're going to switch the algorithm to the super and let's include that.

[16:50] Right now we play this.

[16:55] Kind of boring, so now I'm going to add some release.

[17:01] Right, so then if I play some nice, some chords, like let's say here real quick.

[17:13] Come more to life by adding a filter that's going to add character.

[17:16] Remember filters add character.

[17:18] Let's use maybe a low 28 this time, not the MG low one.

[17:22] And now if we play.

[17:27] Let's use an envelope to open it up.

[17:29] We're going to use a very long decay and release.

[17:34] And let's just dial this in.

[17:36] We're not going to make it too fat.

[17:36] Let's make this punchy right now.

[17:38] And now let's play.

[17:41] More up.

[17:47] Like it doesn't sound dope because as I let go of the note, it doesn't linger enough.

[17:51] So now I can add more release here.

[17:53] Let's make the super saws matter more by optimizing the volume of the super saw.

[18:00] So that it has movement, maybe a bit more attack to make it more flowy, less.

[18:05] And now let's see how it sounds.

[18:08] Still need more release.

[18:12] There we go.

[18:25] That sounds nicer.

[18:27] And as I do that, right, maybe more decay.

[18:30] Let's try even more attack.

[18:31] We'll round it out.

[18:32] We'll add more resonance.

[18:34] In fact, let's add another envelope that increases the resonance and brings it down.

[18:39] And then let's see how that sounds.

[18:56] Let's add another saw.

[18:58] But this saw, I want more of a on top.

[19:02] So now we can add a band pass to layer this B saw more detuned.

[19:08] And we're going to put it more up here.

[19:10] And on this guy, we're also going to add maybe one of these guys here, but not a lot.

[19:14] Just a little bit to help it move.

[19:30] Almost sounds like there's there's some form of reverb, right?

[19:35] And that's because of this guy.

[19:36] It was way too detuned.

[19:37] Let's put this up an octave.

[19:38] Let's try one more time here.

[19:40] Let's play.

[19:56] Right.

[19:57] That was a nice superstar sound.

[19:59] From there, let's make a growl.

[20:01] Step one, we're going to find a nice spectral wavetable because we don't have access to FM and all that.

[20:06] So we can't really do a lot to make growls.

[20:08] But again, we can get creative with it.

[20:10] So let's find a good wavetable that's going to give us some good movement.

[20:14] Let's put it at a bass range.

[20:21] All right. So I got to find a pocket.

[20:22] Once I found that I can use Envelope 2, I'm going to add it at some attack.

[20:26] I'm going to use this to round it out.

[20:28] And I'm going to add something like this to shape it a bit better.

[20:32] And we're going to route this to wavetable position.

[20:39] Okay. And now let's find a pocket.

[20:42] Something that's inspiring.

[20:44] That's cool. Let's add some unison.

[20:47] Okay.

[20:48] Now we're kind of getting something cool, but from here, what makes a growl a growl is manipulation of frequency,

[20:53] which we can do with filters and also the manipulation of the wave.

[20:56] The wave isn't doing enough to get a growl.

[20:58] Now we can use some of these alt warps in order to add even more movement.

[21:02] Let's try adding a PWM, see how that sounds.

[21:06] That doesn't sound growly. That sounds way too like.

[21:11] There we go.

[21:15] Let's play with this.

[21:20] Well, let's see if maybe we can add another layer.

[21:24] Let's keep this bottom.

[21:25] We're going to make this one wide and find maybe another growl wavetable that maybe might help us there a bit better.

[21:30] Get something dope on the sides.

[21:32] And we'll use the same envelope.

[21:37] And let's use the filter to remove some of the lows.

[21:42] There we go.

[21:47] All right, cool.

[21:48] And then from there, let's use a filter.

[21:49] One of the multi ones to give this growl a bit more movement.

[21:53] So let's see what we can do here.

[21:54] I want something like I can get like a low pass high pass together or like some peaks.

[22:00] I'd be sick.

[22:01] Yeah, like these might be cool if we can get a peak in a notch.

[22:04] There we go.

[22:05] So now I can move this one way and the notch another way.

[22:10] Let's see how it sounds.

[22:12] There we go.

[22:13] And now move this.

[22:16] And there we go.

[22:18] If I want to get crazier with the growl, we don't have access to the effects.

[22:21] But again, you know, it's like a practice sesh, right?

[22:25] Use what you know that you've learned in the series so far.

[22:28] So we know those filters are crazy good.

[22:31] So in the filter episode, we learned how we can have filter one go to filter two instead of going straight out.

[22:36] So now they're in serial.

[22:38] Sounds go to filter one and then they go to filter two and filter two.

[22:41] I want to add one of those crazy filters.

[22:43] That's probably going to add a lot to the sound.

[22:45] So let's try an all pass real quick.

[22:52] And let's route it to the cutoff.

[22:59] Try this.

[23:02] There we go.

[23:05] This is making the sound a little too like it's losing high end.

[23:09] So let's use the mix.

[23:14] Color on top.

[23:21] Okay, let's see.

[23:27] Let's see if we can distort these guys in their individual channels with the distort feature.

[23:31] Let's try a sine fold.

[23:35] And then here too on this guy and see what happens there.

[23:43] Cool.

[23:45] Resonance here.

[23:45] Let's put it down.

[23:48] Cool.

[23:48] I like this, but I don't like the shape.

[23:52] I'm looking for something particular.

[23:56] If this is the best we get with this, it's fine.

[23:59] It's fine.

[24:04] Cool.

[24:04] Let's see season two filters.

[24:06] Maybe there's something missing there we can use.

[24:08] Come to let's try that.

[24:09] I heard that one's really crazy.

[24:13] There we go.

[24:14] There's one more thing I want to try and I want to resample this sound by holding C.

[24:20] And then I'm going to go here, click, drag out.

[24:23] And I'm going to put it into a spectral to see what happens.

[24:27] This is going to be like the interesting layer.

[24:30] We're going to do that.

[24:34] Can we do anything here?

[24:35] I know there's some presets we can use.

[24:37] Maybe we can find like a nice.

[24:40] Something cool.

[24:44] That sounds kind of cool.

[24:45] Futuristic.

[24:49] Let's go now to the matrix.

[24:51] I'm going to show you guys a cool trick.

[24:52] We can use Envelope 3 there and then we can do a global master tuning.

[24:56] This is something I saw in some webs where I was like, oh, shit.

[24:58] Like, why didn't I think of that?

[25:00] We're going to go from the bottom up.

[25:01] Unipolar one direction.

[25:05] There we go.

[25:10] OK, let's see.

[25:11] Maybe some attack.

[25:13] Go up instead.

[25:16] There you go.

[25:18] Let's make a re-space.

[25:24] Play it.

[25:28] We're going to now use an envelope to give it more of a hit.

[25:32] Lower it down to this.

[25:33] Long decay.

[25:36] Let's add more saws.

[25:39] Maybe one up an octave here.

[25:55] We go with one voice, one voice.

[25:57] And then fine tune it a bit.

[26:07] There we go.

[26:08] Now we can maybe add another spectral sound wide.

[26:13] 

[26:26] Let's route an envelope to the wavetable position.

[26:29] This is like getting experimental as heck, but you never know.

[26:45] Let me show you guys some other nice sounds that I've been making.

[26:49] I've been practicing because I've been making Minimal Nights Volume 3 for you guys.

[26:52] So I'm going to create something very flowy.

[26:55] I'm going to be using a flute sound from the multi-sample.

[26:59] I'm going to teach you guys something cool.

[27:01] Let's go multi-sample or sample.

[27:03] Actually, I think we need like a pan flute.

[27:07] Let's see if they have it.

[27:08] Yep, it's right here.

[27:15] So what I like to do, I'm going to grab this guy, bring it over here.

[27:19] And then I'm going to go here and we can turn it into a wavetable.

[27:25] I believe by switch to wavetable and in here, let's use 1024.

[27:30] Find a nice spot, detune it.

[27:35] Let's use a filter on that wave to create a wide layer for this flute.

[27:42] Right click or go here.

[27:43] We're going to normalize it.

[27:46] Just to get it loud.

[27:49] Now we create these type of sounds.

[28:02] Okay, so nice to use.

[28:04] With effects, it comes to life like you'll play.

[28:08] It's delay, reverb.

[28:14] It's quiet.

[28:21] Let me show you guys another sick sound.

[28:23] We can use a sine distortion and sine fold it.

[28:31] And then just have it come from up down like this.

[28:35] Slow, slow.

[28:39] And let's omit out the low end.

[28:50] And of course, acid sounds.

[28:52] So if we go here, we can create acid sounds now.

[28:55] High resonance, pull back.

[28:58] Saw to begin with, envelope 2.

[29:00] And.

[29:45] All right.

[29:46] So now you saw how envelopes can help us make pads, leads, wubs, even growls.

[29:51] But in the next episode, we're going to get into LFOs, which will help us bring these sounds to closer to that finish, finish level.

[29:58] It's going to allow us to do a lot of really crazy stuff, so make sure to tune in for that.

[30:01] But with that being said, you guys take care and I'll see you guys next time for another video.

[30:04] You guys take care and have a great rest of your day.
