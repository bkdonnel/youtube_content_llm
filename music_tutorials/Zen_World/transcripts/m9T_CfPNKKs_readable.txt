================================================================================

[00:00] Yo what's up ninjas? We've been making some sick sounds but we've been

[00:05] lacking a bit of dynamics and a bit of change. Well today that's gonna change

[00:09] because we're gonna be learning about envelopes which is gonna allow us to

[00:11] make punchy basses, pads, lush leads and sounds that move that change over time.

[00:18] In Serum 2, envelope 1 is routed to the volume by default and I think volume is

[00:23] one of the best ways to learn the ADSR system that most envelopes are gonna use.

[00:29] So max volume is gonna be decided by the main volume and the levels inside

[00:34] each oscillator. They're all gonna be controlled by this envelope 1. So for

[00:38] example at the moment if we increase the attack of the sound the sound will

[00:43] gradually come in and that's because the attack controls the first part of an

[00:50] envelope which is how long it takes for us to reach the max value which with

[00:56] this envelope we can't really move or change okay. So that's gonna be decided

[00:59] by wherever everything your levels are set. Something to note here is that I can

[01:04] also play with the slope of this. Very important because if I want to dial in

[01:09] the sound more and with how I envision it slope is gonna allow us to gradually

[01:17] go in or slowly come up and then all of a sudden get to that desired loudness

[01:22] which can be useful for brassy sounds. To the right of that we have a hold which

[01:26] we're gonna come back to after we go through decay sustain and release. Now

[01:30] decay is gonna control once the attack phase is over we're at the max amplitude.

[01:35] Decay controls how long it takes for us to go from that max amplitude to our

[01:39] sustain. Okay and our sustain is the value in this instance the volume. What

[01:44] we're gonna stay at as the MIDI note is held after the attack and decay phase

[01:49] have passed. And then I move it down. Volume is coming down. I'm still holding the note you

[01:54] can see that here. I go up mid. With sustain I can lower it down to around

[01:59] let's say 75% of the way down. And now decay when we move it you're gonna hear

[02:06] what it does. Okay so decay controls value coming from that max amplitude to

[02:15] the sustain. However decay is also very useful for pretty much adding perceived

[02:21] punch to a sound. Okay from there we have our release which is gonna control

[02:27] the fade out of the sound after I let go of the note. So right now I'm stuck in

[02:32] sustain because I'm holding down the note but once I let go the release kicks

[02:36] in and that release decides how long the sound lingers for before it reaches back

[02:41] to quiet no sound or a value of zero change. Hold what it's gonna do is it's

[02:46] gonna hold after the attack phase it's gonna hold max amplitude for however

[02:51] much time you set. Now the way this is useful is let's say that I have a sound

[02:56] or I'm creating a sound for future rave or melodic techno where I want a lead

[03:00] that's gonna be very staccato. Okay now I can definitely program a lead that's

[03:06] staccato without the hold with a high sustain. The problem with that is as a

[03:10] sound designer I've noticed some people need a bit of guidance and I need to

[03:13] make it easy for them to use the sound as intended. Okay so with the hold I can

[03:18] have it be so that when someone presses the note even for a long time

[03:26] the hold limits that. So now when they play and I make it super punchy now there's a

[03:36] couple of things that we can do here. Number one we can change the value or

[03:40] the time right sec milliseconds to 1 eighths, 1 fourths, sixteenths if you like that

[03:48] system a lot better which I can find use for that whenever I'm trying to create

[03:51] an effect let's say I want the effect to come up for a bar and then I want it to

[03:56] go down for two bars which might be useful for something like creating a

[04:00] noise swell. And there we go you know goes up a bar and goes down for two bars

[04:07] so that's where it might be useful. The other thing too is if you notice here if

[04:11] I increase the decay I cannot see what's happening after that so here I have by

[04:15] pulling up a zoom out feature and by pulling down I zoom in okay and I also

[04:19] have a lock feature which locked itself automatically zoom in for me which is

[04:23] good and bad. The reason I say good and bad is because sometimes I'll do this

[04:26] and I'm like yep that that definitely looks like how a pad should be shaped

[04:30] and then I'll play it and the sound doesn't last how it should so that's the

[04:34] drawback of that so sometimes I just like to zoom out like this and then do

[04:39] this. Envelope one is routed to the volume so what else can you route

[04:43] envelopes to? The most common common common common things that they would add

[04:48] envelopes to are the filter cutoff to create plucks so here I'm gonna use

[04:54] envelope two and open up the cutoff and I'll lower down the sustain and use

[05:00] decay to get the punch. Now let's talk a little bit about what's going on here so

[05:03] you can understand and now you know not in the volume but more about value of

[05:07] moving knobs so by clicking here and dragging I can drag this to any knob you

[05:11] can see there's a plus wherever I can drag it somewhere okay now from there

[05:16] this blue line appears and this blue line is gonna tell us the modulation

[05:20] amount how much do we want to change whatever knob we're on in this scenario

[05:24] how much do we want to open up the cutoff by okay so that's what that blue

[05:28] line does now in terms of the envelope the way you want to see it is change if

[05:32] we increase the attack by an envelope one that is deciding how long it

[05:36] takes for us to increase the volume to max volume max amplitude in this

[05:41] scenario it's how long it takes for us to go from this side of the knob to the

[05:44] at the end of the blue line so if I wanted to create a wub I would add attack

[05:49] play low then I will use a square

[05:59] kind of there right if you know you know and if you don't enjoy your youth

[06:03] okay so from there a little bit of resonance right we can create sounds like

[06:09] this the other thing is lower the attack back down you know we have this you know

[06:14] an odd mobby sound so here decay is controlling how long it takes for us to

[06:18] go from that end of the blue line back to the original value where the cutoffs

[06:22] at because the sustain is all the way down if the sustain is somewhere in the

[06:25] middle it's gonna linger in the middle now why is this useful here well I'm

[06:31] gonna show you guys why let's say you're making a bass line you're like okay I

[06:35] want to punch you so you pull it down you do this you move this here you go

[06:39] this and you're holding it down but now when you hold it down let's say you're

[06:42] in a song and there's drums the issue here now is is that you can't really

[06:46] hear the bass I mean you can feel the sub right so this is where you might

[06:50] decide to hold the note bring your sustain up you're like okay the bass is

[06:54] fat there and if it was stayed here we should be able to hear it and feel it so

[07:00] now when I play it notice when I increase the release here nothing really

[07:07] happens and the reason for that is because the release in an envelope it's

[07:11] only gonna matter if there's sound to begin with right so if our envelope one

[07:15] the volume there's no volume because we let go and there's no release and you're

[07:18] gonna hear it but if I add the release now you can hear the release kicking in

[07:26] on this the second place that most analog synths allow you to route an

[07:34] envelope to remember the limitations they've set and what most of them have

[07:38] in common is the pitch and there's a lot of techniques here to deal with the

[07:43] pitch okay the first thing is if I go to a sign I can use an envelope and route it

[07:47] here and then I can lower down the sustain to create lasers okay now notice

[07:55] that when I put this on there this line is going left and right it's not going

[08:02] in one direction well that's because we are in bipolar mode now and Serum's

[08:06] gonna decide whether it's in bipolar mode or unipolar mode depending on what

[08:09] you put it on and what the value of that knob or the pitch is so to change that

[08:14] let's you just want to go up and back to the original pitch you're gonna hold

[08:17] option or alt shift click on that blue little knob and you make it unipolar you

[08:23] can also go into the matrix and you're gonna see here polarity and then you're

[08:26] gonna highlight this and bipolar off but if we turn it on now it goes in both

[08:30] directions again and we can also click there to turn it back to a unipolar one

[08:35] now this pitch knob the cool thing about it is one we can create essentially

[08:39] downlifters like so let's put some detunement

[08:48] okay we can create effects like this add a bit of attack this is gonna make it so

[08:52] that the pitch slowly goes up again and then it comes down

[08:57] very iconic the other thing too is if we go to the right really fast lower the

[09:02] decay we can add like a like almost like a snap on top of the sound use a

[09:11] triangle sounds fucking great I like for creating these kind of and create 808 or

[09:20] knocky bass lines this way add a bit of release let's use the distortion here

[09:29] and now boom slam that thing okay the other thing too now is we can also go

[09:37] the other way which gives us a essentially like a

[09:43] hello Chris Slate add a bit of attack

[09:52] right we could do a lot of really cool stuff we can add that to wubs and and

[09:58] and so forth okay the other thing we can do this for is check it we can add

[10:01] it to the octave range here and you get that and then the cool thing about serum

[10:13] 2 now is that when you highlight and move it now it tells you where you're

[10:16] going from to what and I love that because back then it wouldn't tell you

[10:20] so you would have to just dial it in by ear and by eye now from there with

[10:25] envelopes the best way to learn them and the best way to learn anything when

[10:29] you learn is to make some sounds so why don't we make a couple of sounds so that

[10:33] you guys can see the workflow on how to use them okay so the first one we can

[10:37] make is a bass so let's make a very really nice stack bass okay so what

[10:43] we're gonna do is go minus 2 on this first oscillator which is gonna be our

[10:46] sub layer or our lower layer for the bass we're gonna go with a square a very

[10:50] common sub oscillator to use for more moggy and aggressive bass lines on the

[10:56] top I'm gonna add a saw minus 1 1 octave above this one we're gonna random phase

[11:03] it for now and now we're gonna use a filter out both for them and pull the

[11:07] cutoff back now if you want some tips here from experience to make a good bass

[11:12] that's gonna sound good what I like to do is I'll play this and I'll set the

[11:17] cutoff point by ear where I still hear the bass how I would want it heard when

[11:22] sustained and then I'm gonna use an envelope now to open it up to a certain

[11:28] amount I'm gonna lower down the sustain and there we go a little higher up now

[11:38] the level matters I want where the saw is influencing the bass more than the

[11:43] but the square is still providing that low-end body the identity of this bass

[11:51] will come from how much you open up by the decay you set sustain the resonance

[12:14] and there we go let's add a bit of key track pull it back more and I'll set the

[12:29] envelope to the resonance if you wanted to now we can make that saw be a seventh

[12:39] let's lower the DB pull we already know what all that does let's change the

[12:44] square to a saw

[12:55] let's get our values right here because you're gonna see the values will really

[13:00] dictate how a live punchy this bass is let's also make sure we have saws that

[13:06] match well together we're gonna use the same one so they don't phase out

[13:13] that's a breather from Ableton

[13:35] and notice that the bass I'm doing it but you don't really feel too much of

[13:41] a punch even though we have stuff going on and that's because we also have to

[13:45] optimize the volume right the envelope can shape the sound with the frequency

[13:49] removal in addition bringing it back with an envelope but we also want to

[13:52] play with the volume a bit now a key thing here is don't do this because you

[13:56] didn't it out too much but you do want some form of reducement in volume but

[14:00] not too much I'm gonna add a hint of release just to help whenever I play too

[14:06] Now the other type of bass I can make is also keep it simple

[14:34] here I can increase the resonance to create a very housey bass make it a wub

[14:45] by increasing the attack I'm gonna increase the sustain here on this guy

[14:54] now let's get creative let's add a saw an octave up with detunement so again

[15:08] you can do all of that with the basic shapes in fact I would make a case that

[15:12] with the basic shapes if you're making a rolling bass for instance you know the

[15:16] important thing is that envelope super important because it's gonna dictate how

[15:19] your bass sounds so I'm just gonna put an ARP here so that it rolls I'm gonna

[15:24] put this at 128 BPM

[15:29] okay I'm gonna play to create a rolling bass I'm gonna also do a shift 12 we'll

[15:36] talk about this once we get to this section but I'm just doing it to kind of

[15:39] show you a little bit more on the envelope side of stuff

[15:44] okay very important that you set this right your volume to now watch if I make

[15:49] this too long bass is fine right it's but it's a little muffled here you feel

[15:54] it more switch it to a square by this one maybe you might want a little bit

[16:01] more maybe this goes more down so that the bass doesn't sound too fat okay

[16:18] super cool like we can make that and then from there at another saw here I'm

[16:30] gonna use a high pass here on this guy like this okay from there let's make a

[16:41] super solid that's very trancy flowy so we're just gonna use eight sauce we're

[16:46] gonna switch the algorithm to the super and let's include that right now we play

[16:50] this kind of boring so now I'm gonna add some release

[17:00] right so then if I play some nice some chords like let's say here real quick

[17:13] come more to life by adding a filter that's gonna add character remember

[17:16] filters add character let's use maybe a low 28 this time not the mg low one and

[17:22] now if we play let's use an envelope to open it up we're gonna use a very long

[17:31] decay and release and let's just dial this in we're not gonna make this punchy

[17:37] right now and now let's play more like it doesn't sound dope because as I let

[17:50] go of the note it doesn't linger enough so now I can add more release here let's

[17:53] make the super sauce matter more by optimizing the volume of the super saw

[18:00] so that it has movement maybe a bit more attack to make it more flowy less and

[18:04] now let's see how it sounds still need more release there we go

[18:25] that sounds nicer and as I do that right maybe more decay let's try even more

[18:31] attack we'll round it out we'll add more resonance in fact let's add another

[18:35] envelope that increases the resonance and brings it down and then let's see

[18:43] how that sounds

[18:56] let's add another saw but this saw I want more of a on top so now we can add

[19:02] a band pass to layer this be saw saw more detuned and we're gonna put it more

[19:09] up here and on this guy we're also gonna add maybe one of these guys here but not

[19:14] a lot just a little bit to help it move

[19:30] almost sounds like there's there's some form of reaver right and that's because

[19:36] of this guy it was way too detuned let's put this up an octave let's try one more

[19:39] time here let's play

[19:56] right that was a nice super saw sound from there let's make

[20:00] growl. Step one we're gonna find a nice spectral wavetable because we don't

[20:04] have access to FM and all that so we can't really do a lot to make growls but

[20:08] again we can get creative with it. So let's find a good wavetable that's gonna

[20:11] give us some good movement. Let's put it at a bass range.

[20:21] Alright so I got to find a pocket. Once I found it I can use envelope 2. I'm gonna

[20:24] add it at some attack. I'm gonna use this to round it out and I'm gonna add

[20:29] something like this to shape it a bit better and we're gonna route this to

[20:34] wavetable position. Okay and now let's find a pocket. Something that's inspiring.

[20:44] That's cool. Let's add some unison. Okay now we're kind of getting something cool

[20:49] but from here what makes a growl a growl is a manipulation of frequency which we

[20:53] can do with filters and also the manipulation of the wave. The wave isn't

[20:57] doing enough to get a growl. We can use some of these alt warps in order to add

[21:00] even more movement. Let's try adding a PWM see how that sounds. That doesn't

[21:07] sound growly. That sounds way too like. There we go.

[21:15] Let's play with this.

[21:20] Well let's see maybe we can add another layer. Let's keep this bottom. We're gonna

[21:25] make this one wide and find maybe another growl wavetable that maybe might

[21:29] help us there a bit better. Get something dope on the sides and we'll use the same

[21:33] envelope. And let's use the filter to remove some of the lows. There we go.

[21:47] Alright cool and then from there let's use a filter one of the multi ones to

[21:50] give this growl a bit more movement. So let's see what we can do here. I want

[21:55] something like if I can get like a low pass high pass together or like some

[21:59] peaks I'd be sick. Yeah like these might be cool if we can get a peak in a notch.

[22:04] There we go. So now I can move this one way and the notch another way. Let's see

[22:10] how it sounds. There we go and now move this. And there we go. If I want to get

[22:19] crazier with the growl we don't have access to the effects but again you know

[22:23] it's like a practice sesh right. Use what you know that you've learned in the

[22:27] series so far. So we know those filters are crazy good. So in the filter episode

[22:32] we learned how we can have filter one go to filter two instead of going straight

[22:36] out. So now they're in serial. Sounds go to filter one and then they go to filter

[22:40] two. And filter two I want to add one of those crazy filters that's probably

[22:43] going to add a lot to the sound. So let's try an all pass real quick.

[22:52] And let's route it to the cutoff.

[23:02] There we go. This is making the sound a little too like it's using high-end so

[23:09] let's use the mix. Color on top. Okay let's see. Let's see if we can distort

[23:28] these guys in their individual channels with the distort feature. Let's try a

[23:44] cool resonance here. Let's put it down. Well I like this but I don't like the

[23:50] shape. I'm looking for something particular. This is the best we get with

[23:57] this. It's fine. It's fine. Cool. Let's see season two filters. Maybe there's

[24:06] something missing there we can use. Comb two. Let's try that. I heard that one's really crazy.

[24:13] There we go. There's one more thing I want to try and I want to resample this

[24:17] sound by holding C. And then I'm gonna go here. Click. Drag out. And I'm gonna put

[24:24] it into a spectral to see what happens. This is gonna be like the interesting

[24:29] layer. We're gonna do that. Can we do anything here? I know there's some

[24:36] presets we can use. Maybe we can find like a nice something cool. That sounds

[24:44] kind of cool futuristic. Let's go now to the matrix. I'm gonna show you guys a

[24:51] cool trick. We can use envelope 3 there and then we can do a global master

[24:55] tuning. This is something I saw in some webs where I was like oh shit. Like why

[24:59] didn't I think of that? We're gonna go from the bottom up. Unipolar one

[25:02] direction. There we go.

[25:10] Okay let's see maybe some attack. Go up a step. Let's make a re-space.

[25:27] We're gonna now use an envelope to give it more of a hit. Lower it down to this.

[25:35] Long decay.

[25:38] Maybe one up an octave here.

[25:55] We go with one voice one voice and then fine-tune it a bit.

[26:07] There we go. Now we can maybe add this another spectral sound wide.

[26:26] Let's route an envelope to the wavetable position. This is like getting

[26:30] experimental as heck but you never know.

[26:45] Let me show you guys some other nice sounds that I've been making. I've been

[26:50] making Minimal Nights volume 3 for you guys. So I'm gonna create something very

[26:54] flowy. I'm gonna be using a flute sound from the multi-sample and I'm gonna

[26:59] teach you guys something cool. Let's go multi-sample or sample actually. I think

[27:04] we need like a pan flute. Let's see if they have it. Yep it's right here.

[27:15] So what I like to do I'm gonna grab this guy bring it over here and then I'm

[27:20] gonna go here and we can turn it into a wavetable. I believe I switch to wavetable

[27:27] and in here let's use 1024. Find a nice spot detune it. Let's use a filter on

[27:36] that wave to create a wide layer for this flute. Right-click or go here we're

[27:43] gonna normalize it just to get it loud. Now we create these type of sounds and

[28:02] okay so nice nice nice to use with the facts it comes to life like you'll play

[28:08] it's the delay reverb. Let me show you guys another sick sound we can use a

[28:24] sine distortion and sine fold it and then just have it come from up down like

[28:34] this. And of course acid sounds. So if we go here we can create acid sounds now

[28:55] high-resonance pull back saw to begin with envelope 2 and

[29:45] I guess so now you saw how envelopes can help us make pads leads wubs even growls

[29:51] but in the next episode we're gonna get into LFOs which will help us bring these

[29:55] sounds to closer to that finish finish level. It's gonna allow us to do a lot of

[29:59] really crazy stuff so make sure to tune in for that but with that being said you

[30:02] guys take care and I'll see you guys next time for another video you guys

[30:05] take care and have a great rest of your day!
