================================================================================

[00:00] Hey, what's up ninjas? Hopefully you guys are having a good holiday season

[00:04] It's currently no chabuena or as I say Mexican Christmas Day because tomorrow for a lot of us

[00:09] It's national hangover day

[00:11] But hopefully you guys are spending it with your family and hopefully you guys are gonna be having a kick-ass time now today

[00:17] We're gonna be getting into serum twos

[00:20] FM section which you're gonna access

[00:22] By clicking the warp and going below distortion where you're gonna find a lot of modulations

[00:28] Like FM which stands for frequency modulation PD, which is the old serum FM known as phase distortion AM

[00:35] Which is amplitude modulation

[00:37] Amplitude just meaning the volume of the sound and then ring modulation are M. So we're gonna be able to route

[00:44] multiple different modulation sources

[00:47] Usually in this scenario, it's gonna be either the oscillator BC the filter outputs sub oscillator and even the noise

[00:53] Okay FM frequency modulation as the name entails. We're modulating the frequency of this oscillator

[00:59] However, it's gonna be done in a way where if you can hear a sound source

[01:05] Like this this sign is moving at a really fast rate

[01:08] So it wouldn't really modulate like we did with the LFO unless we're playing it at a very high rate

[01:13] Or it wouldn't modulate like an envelope. It's gonna modulate so fast that it's gonna produce harmonics like distortion

[01:19] But in its own way, it's gonna add new stuff. So already know the sine wave

[01:24] It's just that little mountain

[01:27] that

[01:28] You know, it's pure innocence and with FM

[01:31] We're gonna add multiple overtones and the way we add them is gonna be dependent on how we program by default

[01:37] We have a through zero activated down here

[01:40] the best way to kind of think of true zero is that the FM will most likely always stay in pitch unless it's being

[01:46] Used at very high values the other thing and I'm gonna quote the serum manual for this causes carrier oscillator

[01:52] Which is this one the one producing the sound to continue to oscillate correctly

[01:55] Even when its frequency is modulated into negative values by the modulator oscillator

[02:00] Okay, the way I like to think about it true. So just really is gonna be the cleaner one

[02:04] It's also gonna be the one that relatively stays more in key and according to serum

[02:08] It's useful for lush metallic or bell like tones to apply the FM

[02:12] We're gonna have oscillator B

[02:13] And keeping to notice the level needs to be down so that we can treat this more as a modulation source rather than a sound

[02:19] However, you can also have it up if you feel it adds to the sound or it's a thing that you might want

[02:24] But from here, I'm gonna have both of these set to an octave of zero to sir

[02:29] Okay, and I'm gonna increase this

[02:33] And as I increase it I want you to take note of the extra harmonics the overtones we're adding besides that fundamental

[02:45] Now

[02:46] Keeping with a fem is that oscillator be right the one that is modulating it

[02:51] It's pitch is very it's gonna affect the way that sounds very dramatically

[02:55] So for example right now, we're gonna have a one-to-one ratio a ratio where they're equal, right?

[03:00] So we're producing more of the same frequency range

[03:05] Okay

[03:05] As this one however the higher this octave goes which would increase the FM ratio

[03:10] That just means again instead of 101 now, this one's up above so it would be one or two

[03:19] Harmonics harmonics that sound even higher right and this is how I like to tweet a femme if you want a bit of theory

[03:24] The higher this one goes up the more it's gonna introduce a higher tone. However, let's say that you're using that first one for a baby

[03:34] Yes, it's good to note here you can see that this

[03:42] And the two and even the one where it's equal are a lot

[03:49] Since we're doing FM now serums allowing us to change the way the pitch reacts for our oscillator

[03:55] so the way we can change it is by right-clicking and

[03:59] Going into mode and now we have three different modes

[04:02] Harmonics ratio is what most FM synthesizers that we know of out there use first thing

[04:08] I want to do is I want to go source and pick the oscillator that's gonna be producing the sound

[04:13] So in this scenario, it's gonna be oscillator a what this is gonna do is if I move this

[04:22] This oscillator is gonna follow it

[04:26] For example here if I'm playing a C and I put the ratio of two I'm gonna have this guy be an octave above

[04:35] If I put it at three

[04:37] We're now in the fifth put it at four

[04:41] And now two octaves five

[04:44] We're on that third, which is the e6 you already know

[04:49] Get that g7

[04:52] Now we're at an a-sharp now all of this only starts to matter when I'm using a fam

[05:08] Okay

[05:10] And one thing to note to us using an envelope on the FM is very common in FM synthesis

[05:15] Sometimes you want that tone, but you don't want it forever

[05:18] So this is when you use an envelope to apply it to the beginning of a sound or throughout the song

[05:23] But it starts to decrease the more the sound plays

[05:35] Like here it's going from an F to an E

[05:41] Assemble one get put to the F sharp

[05:43] When I'm playing the F key

[05:44] This is frequency modulation

[05:46] Even though it doesn't sound like it and I can prove it to you because if we lower the pitch of this guy down to

[05:51] Really low where it turns into a low oscillator like these guys over here. You're gonna hear

[06:15] And it creates static tones

[06:21] Again those are key things to put into mind

[06:23] We're gonna be making some sounds at the end of this video as always to put this knowledge to use because with a fam

[06:27] Right knowing what sounds we can make with it does help a bit and knowing what we can do with it and when to use

[06:32] It up below that we're gonna have through zero to exponential. Okay, so

[06:38] Exponential linear right all that's gonna do is it's gonna change the way the FM is applied

[06:43] So here I have this graph of an exponential

[06:46] Which we would call can also call the compound interest

[06:49] So if you ever into finance or like investing you'll hear people compounding interest is the way to get rich and all this stuff

[06:55] Yeah, so it's because it's gonna like as you can see it starts off similar to a linear

[06:59] But then it starts to go faster and faster the more to the right we go and eventually it just blows up

[07:04] This leads to the FM as you move it sounding a lot more drastic

[07:08] Versus a linear one is gonna be as you can see just constantly going at its pace or exponent

[07:21] Linear

[07:30] I want to quote something with the serum to manual which explains a couple of things which I don't know from what I hear

[07:36] It doesn't feel too true. But again, it could be issues. Maybe I'm just not doing it, right?

[07:41] Linear is often described as smooth clean and more musical

[07:45] Compared to other femme types such as exponential this makes it great for bell like tones pads and other complex but stable timbres

[07:55] And this is what I mean like I'll do linear and move around

[08:01] But it feels like it goes out of key in fact the one that doesn't is the true zero

[08:09] I

[08:10] Find true sir is the one that keeps its its key a lot better. For example, the one that is linear or exponential

[08:20] It's the kind you'll find like on a Jupiter 6 or Jupiter 8 sin

[08:25] Like if you use the Arturia stuff, there's this cross mod one that you can use

[08:32] And

[08:33] This sounds exactly like it the next warp we have is gonna be the PD which stands for face

[08:39] Distortion, so you're pretty much gonna be altering the face

[08:44] Of the sound

[08:46] with another

[08:49] Oscillator, so for instance here this to this to me. It sounds very similar to FM

[09:02] And

[09:03] Similar to FM

[09:19] The pitch and the ratios matter

[09:22] This is a traditional sermon FM and the way I like to see it

[09:25] Remember if you like the sounds most people were making with sermon when they did FM on there

[09:30] Then usually you want to go with the PD the face

[09:32] distortion over the

[09:34] Traditional FM you're gonna be able to route the seed the noise the sub the filter outputs and its own self now

[09:40] Which back then you couldn't do and I've never heard with that it

[09:44] So I'm gonna assume this is a feedback

[09:49] Because in some FM sounds to create the iconic sauce sound like the lately bass

[09:54] It would have to feed back into itself in order to produce something that sounded almost like a saw and

[10:01] This sounds exactly like it

[10:08] Now to the bottom of that we have amplitude

[10:11] Modulation similar to FM except the amplitude the volume is modulated this guy here now

[10:16] I can show you that it's actual volume automation because if I again lower this one all the way down

[10:22] Gonna see that it's the volume starts to

[10:44] Next thing we have is ring modulation

[10:52] You

[10:55] Now the best way to think about ring modulation, it's gonna be the multiplication of both of these guys

[11:01] So again, we're dealing here with like the pitch now with RM. Usually the way I like to think about it is at low values

[11:08] It provides

[11:09] movement to a sound

[11:13] But at high volumes the problem that starts to occurs as you multiply so you start to create

[11:17] Instability in the sound making it sound more atonal making it good for

[11:23] Sound the same of drums sound the same for techno sound the same of metallic objects instead of it

[11:29] Sounding harmonically rich like the face distortion with RM. You're creating more of a hollow sound

[11:34] You're creating more of a metallic sound and unstable sound. So when I say unstable just

[11:40] See it like this, right? I have two sauce here. They're stable. They're playing the same note

[11:45] But the moment that I get one out of key

[11:54] I

[11:54] Starts to sound very unstable now, let's bring another one into the equation

[12:02] You know, it's not gonna be melodic we're not gonna go that sounds beautiful now we're gonna see that sounds fierce that sounds aggressive now

[12:09] Serum twos manual doesn't really explain ring modulation

[12:11] But I guess the best way to kind of see it is the ring modulation as we said, right? It's gonna distort

[12:17] It's gonna ruin harmonic relationships making it sound atonal and it does that because what it's doing it's gonna be multiplying between these two, right?

[12:24] We're gonna get the sum of both

[12:25] Oscillators and the difference and then we produce new frequencies out of it, which are not going to be related harmonically

[12:34] Those are gonna be our more advanced warp modulations that we have that I wanted to talk about later

[12:39] Now the crazy thing about serum 2 is that it allows you to actually a femme

[12:45] Sounds like for instance sampled bass sounds similar to Ableton Ableton also allows you to do that

[12:50] For example, if I have a brass sound here

[13:00] So the way that I use that in my sound design is sometimes I'll create

[13:04] Sounds that are normal right like a guitar like a brass shot. I'm like use it as a brass shot

[13:08] However, I always like to add mods for this stuff because as you can hear

[13:17] You

[13:17] Can create some really crazy sounds with a sample getting a femme from a saw like it's crazy to me like it's insane

[13:28] And this is when you would use a sub I always get asked a lot by people I wouldn't use a sub in production stuff

[13:33] So as a sound designer for me use a sub when you have a sound that you like the tone of but it's gonna be

[13:39] Impossible to mix low and into it and even then let's say you were able

[13:43] To mix low and into it by the usage of a high shelf boost or a bell EQ

[13:48] There's always trade-offs when you're EQ in when you're boosting by huge amounts

[13:53] You can cause your frequencies to last longer than it should which is what you will people will refer to as ringing frequencies, right?

[14:00] You can cause phase shifts with like extreme EQ shifts

[14:04] So a lot of the times you want to avoid that right and you avoid it by using a sine wave as your sub

[14:10] So we're gonna do that here. We're gonna put it

[14:13] Probably at the same sub range as this because if we look at the EQ

[14:18] There is sub frequency there, but it's just not as good and it's also pulsating

[14:22] It's constantly moving which means that if we want that effect that works

[14:25] But if we want a constant low end to be felt in the car in the club, then we want to use a sine wave

[14:30] That's gonna be playing

[14:34] Now do I have to cut out the frequencies from this guy in order to do that?

[14:38] No, because what tends to happen with phase cancellation, which is what most people want to deal with is it's relative to volume

[14:46] So what that means is that if the subs in this sound aren't as loud as the sub I'm about to put

[14:52] There's low risk and of cancelling out and also if cancellation does occur, right? They they cancel each other out

[15:00] It's not gonna be like a complete serial cancellation it's gonna be a very minimal one because the sub isn't as loud

[15:16] So now let's put some reverb

[15:31] I'm on a legato portamento. I'm gonna have this increase

[15:42] We're gonna add this crossfade

[15:48] Set an LFO, let's just get fancy with it

[15:50] The other one was fine, but we're gonna add a bit of an LFO moving at a slow rate

[15:54] I really don't know what I want. And in that scenario if I don't know what I want, that's fine

[15:57] I'm just gonna use the again the random curved here or the random flat and use the smooth feature

[16:06] Dick okay the reaver by the way, it's a clutch in the sense that

[16:11] You know, we put it because it makes anything sound good. So

[16:16] Trolling these frequencies more since the sound moves around a lot

[16:19] We do want the extreme compression right that the serum to man who states this is

[16:23] So we're just gonna essentially change the tonality of everything by moving these guys up and down

[16:41] Now as I create the sound I'm noticing there's a lack of mid-low

[16:47] In order to access those mid-lows I might try to look for another wavetable that's gonna allow us to

[16:53] Add them in like possibly a monster one. That's gonna be static with that

[17:08] Now too much I guess we could say there's a lot too much overtones on it right too much high-end

[17:14] So we're gonna use a low pass and we're also gonna use a high pass to move some of the low end from it

[17:56] I'm trying to see if there's any way to make the sound more interesting

[18:29] Let's

[18:30] Add a filter now that's gonna provide that interestingness to it

[18:34] You

[18:45] Know what bees let's make a bass

[18:48] So we can do the standard deep house bass as well with this and I'm going to show you guys some of the techniques here

[18:54] That we can use for example

[18:55] The FM can be modulated and a lot of FM since they do modulate it

[18:59] So the way we would do that is route envelope 2 which is gonna be the more traditional route and then we're gonna have it

[19:05] Just open up and then come back to a starting position to give us a nice punchy deep houses

[19:24] This is PD itself

[19:29] 

[19:46] Random fairy trigger

[19:59] You

[20:00] I want to add like a slap delay to this very iconic of back in the day when we

[20:07] had you know EDX and all that good stuff.

[20:20] Another common technique is modulation of the pitches to add that pitch

[20:25] envelope shift that we did even I forgot to lower down the level of the second

[20:54] oscillator.

[22:50] Let's add this nice click layer to it.

[22:53] I'm looking for something that gives this more of a feel of like it's botanical

[22:56] like it's a drum so we're going to go with that conga try that let's make it

[23:06] wide okay now I am going to add OTT the moment you add OTT it might turn into a

[23:22] lap house bass let's add some reverb to this that sounds nice reminds you of those botanical

[23:37] sounds so now and again we're getting crazy here because we don't really have an end

[23:42] goal what we're trying to create so that's why I'm like just going crazy which is again

[23:46] if you want to make precise sounds always have a strategy when you're doing sound design

[23:49] but here I'm just trying to show you guys all the little things I've learned over the

[23:53] years from studying some of my favorite sound designers and some of my favorite packs like

[23:57] Equinox sounds had this botanical pack that was really dope and I loved and they would

[24:01] use a lot of combs to get the this sounding like this now I'm going to add this note

[24:10] so that it's key tracked such a beautiful sound right and we have to control them in

[24:37] and the reverb of course let's go with like a convolution which we talked about this is

[24:42] a good example where I might want to use it because I want to make it feel botanical I'm

[24:46] looking for something that I can't get with this so let's see let's try the weird one

[25:09] let's say I want more high-frequency on this then I'll open up the filter or increase the

[25:51] really nice sound so we made deep house bass we made a botanical pluck we made something like

[25:56] that I don't know what you would use that for I would work more on the mixing of it of course

[26:00] I would want it to sound a little bit more warmer and of course I would go back to my sound design

[26:05] and I would figure out why it sounds cold hey guys so this is gonna be the complete guide to

[26:09] master serum we went over some of the advanced modulations found in the warp section and now

[26:13] you should be able to use them with confidence so experiment with them make sounds with them

[26:17] to see what they can do and most important of all have fun you guys take care and you

[26:21] guys have a great rest of your day
