[00:00] what's up ninjas hopefully you guys are having a good holiday season it's

[00:04] currently Noche Buena or as I say Mexican Christmas Day because tomorrow

[00:08] for a lot of us it's National Hangover Day but hopefully you guys are spending

[00:13] it with your family and hopefully you guys are gonna be having a kick-ass time

[00:17] now today we're gonna be getting into Serum 2's FM section which you're gonna

[00:22] access by clicking the warp and going below distortion where you're gonna find

[00:27] a lot of modulations like FM which stands for frequency modulation, PD

[00:32] which is the old Serum FM known as phase distortion, AM which is amplitude

[00:36] modulation amplitude just meaning the volume of the sound and then ring

[00:41] modulation RM so we're gonna be able to route multiple different modulation

[00:46] sources usually in this scenario it's gonna be either the oscillator BC the

[00:50] filter outputs sub oscillator and even the noise okay FM frequency modulation

[00:56] as the name entails we're modulating the frequency of this oscillator however

[01:00] it's gonna be done in a way where if you can hear a sound source like this this

[01:07] sign is moving at a really fast rate so it wouldn't really modulate like we did

[01:10] with the LFO unless we're playing it at a very high rate or it wouldn't modulate

[01:14] like an envelope it's gonna modulate so fast that it's gonna produce harmonics

[01:18] like distortion but in its own way it's gonna add new stuff so already know the

[01:24] it's just that little mountain that you know it's pure innocence and with FM

[01:31] we're gonna add multiple overtones and the way we add them is gonna be

[01:35] dependent on how we program by default we have a through zero activated down

[01:40] here the best way to kind of think of true zero is that the FM will most

[01:44] likely always stay in pitch unless it's being used at very high values the other

[01:48] thing and I'm gonna quote the Serum manual for this causes carrier oscillator

[01:52] which is this one the one producing the sound to continue to oscillate correctly

[01:55] even when its frequency is modulated into negative values by the modulator

[02:00] oscillator okay the way I like to think about it true zero just really is gonna

[02:03] be the cleaner one it's also gonna be the one that relatively stays more in

[02:07] key and according to serum it's useful for lush metallic or bell like tones to

[02:11] apply the FM we're gonna have oscillator B and keeping to notice the level needs

[02:15] to be down so that we can treat this more as a modulation source rather than

[02:18] a sound however you can also have it up if you feel it adds to the sound or it's

[02:22] a thing that you might want but from here I'm gonna have both of these set to

[02:26] an octave of zero to sir okay and I'm gonna increase this and as I increase it

[02:34] I want you to take note of the extra harmonics the overtones were adding

[02:38] besides that fundamental now a key thing with a fem is that oscillator be

[02:48] right the one that is modulating it its pitch is very it's gonna affect the way

[02:53] that sounds very dramatically so for example right now we're gonna have a one

[02:57] to one ratio a ratio where they're equal right so we're producing more of the

[03:01] same frequency range okay as this one however the higher this octave goes

[03:08] which would increase the FM ratio that just means again instead of one of one

[03:12] now this one's up above so it would be one or two

[03:17] it's like to produce higher harmonics harmonics that sound even higher right

[03:21] and this is how I like to tweet a fem if you want a bit of theory the higher this

[03:25] one goes up the more it's gonna introduce a higher tone however let's

[03:29] say that you're using that first one for a bay yes it's good to note here you can

[03:36] see the distance

[03:40] and the two and even the one where it's equal are a lot since we're doing FM now

[03:51] serums allowing us to change the way the pitch reacts for our oscillator so the

[03:56] way we can change it is by right-clicking and going into mode and

[04:00] now we have three different modes harmonics ratio which is what most FM

[04:05] synthesizers that we know of out there use first thing I want to do is I want

[04:09] to go source and pick the oscillator that's gonna be producing the sound so

[04:13] in this scenario it's gonna be oscillator a what this is gonna do is if

[04:16] I move this this oscillator is gonna follow it

[04:26] for example here if I'm playing a C and I put the ratio of two I'm gonna have

[04:32] this guy be an octave above if I put it at three we're now on the fifth put it

[04:39] at four and now two octaves five we're on that third which is the e6 you already

[04:48] know get that g7 now we're at an a sharp now all of this only starts to matter

[04:55] when I'm using a family okay and one thing to note to us using an envelope on

[05:13] the FM is very common in FM synthesis sometimes you want that tone but you

[05:17] don't want it forever so this is when you use an envelope to apply it to the

[05:21] beginning of a sound or throughout the song but it starts to decrease the more

[05:25] the sound plays

[05:35] like here it's going from an F to an E

[05:41] a sem one gets put as an F sharp when I'm playing the F key this is frequency

[05:46] modulation even though it doesn't sound like it and I can prove it to you

[05:48] because if we lower the pitch of this guy down to really low where it turns

[05:52] into a low oscillator like these guys over here you're gonna hear

[06:16] again those are key things to put into mind we're gonna be making some sounds

[06:24] at the end of this video as always to put this knowledge to use because with

[06:27] FM right knowing what sounds we can make with it does help a bit and knowing

[06:31] what we can do with it and when to use it up below that we're gonna have

[06:34] through zero to exponential okay so exponential linear right all that's

[06:40] gonna do is it's gonna change the way the FM is applied so here I have this

[06:44] graph of an exponential which we would call can also call the compound interest

[06:49] so if you're ever into finance or like investing you'll hear people compounding

[06:52] interest is the way to get rich and all this stuff yeah so it's because it's

[06:57] gonna like as you can see it starts off similar to a linear but then it starts

[07:00] to go faster and faster the more to the right we go and eventually it just blows

[07:04] up this leads to the FM as you move it sounding a lot more drastic versus a

[07:09] linear one is gonna be as you can see just constantly going at its pace or

[07:14] exponent I want to quote something with the serum to manual which explains a

[07:34] couple of things which I don't know well from what I hear it doesn't feel too

[07:37] true but again it could be issues maybe I'm just not doing it right linear is

[07:41] often described as smooth clean and more musical compared to other femme

[07:46] types such as exponential this makes it great for bell like tones pads and other

[07:50] complex but stable timbres and this is what I mean like I'll do linear and move

[08:01] around but it feels like it goes out of key in fact the one that doesn't is the

[08:09] I find true sir is the one that keeps its its key a lot better for example the

[08:14] one that is linear or exponential is the kind you'll find like on a Jupiter 6 or

[08:23] Jupiter 8 sin like if you use the Arturia stuff there's this cross mod one

[08:28] that you can use and this sounds exactly like it the next warp we have is gonna

[08:37] be the PD which stands for face distortion so you're pretty much gonna

[08:41] be altering the face of the sound with another oscillator so for instance here

[08:51] this to this to me it sounds very similar to FM and similar to FM

[09:20] the pitch and the ratios matter this is a traditional sermon FM and the way I

[09:25] like to see it it's just remember if you like the sounds most people were making

[09:28] with sermon when they did FM on there then usually you want to go with the PD

[09:31] the face distortion over the traditional FM you're gonna be able to route to see

[09:37] the noise the sub the filter outputs and its own self now which back then you

[09:41] couldn't do and I've never heard with that it I'm gonna assume this is a

[09:48] feedback because in some FM sounds to create the iconic saw sound like the

[09:53] lately bass it would have to feed back into itself in order to produce

[09:57] like a saw and this sounds exactly like it now to the bottom of that we have

[10:10] amplitude modulation similar to FM except the amplitude the volume is

[10:15] modulated this guy here now I can show you that it's actual volume automation

[10:19] because if I again lower this one all the way down gonna see that it's the

[10:23] starts to create that but eventually we get to a point where it's moving so fast

[10:37] that it produces overtones

[10:44] the next thing we have is ring modulation

[10:55] now the best way to think about ring modulation it's gonna be the

[10:59] multiplication of both of these guys so again we're dealing here with like the

[11:03] pitch now with RM usually the way I like to think about it is at low values it

[11:09] provides movement to a sound but at high volumes the problem that starts to

[11:16] occurs as you multiplies that you start to create instability in the sound

[11:19] making it sound more atonal making it good for sound design of drums sound

[11:25] design for techno sound design of metallic objects instead of it sounding

[11:30] harmonically rich like the phase distortion with RM you're creating more

[11:33] of a hollow sound you're creating more of a metallic sound and unstable sound

[11:38] so when I say unstable just see it like this right I have two saws here they're

[11:42] stable they're playing the same note but the moment that I get one out of key

[11:54] it starts to sound very unstable now let's bring another one into the

[12:02] equation you know it's not gonna be melodic we're not gonna go that sounds

[12:05] beautiful now we're gonna see that sounds fierce that sounds aggressive now

[12:09] Serum 2's manual doesn't really explain ring modulation but I guess the best way

[12:12] to kind of see it is the ring modulation as we said right it's gonna distort it's

[12:17] gonna ruin harmonic relationships making it sound atonal and it does that

[12:21] because what it's doing it's gonna be multiplying between these two right

[12:24] we're gonna get the sum of both oscillators and the difference and then

[12:27] we produce new frequencies out of it which are not gonna be related

[12:33] harmonically those are gonna be our more advanced warp modulations that we have

[12:38] that I wanted to talk about later now the crazy thing about Serum 2 is that it

[12:42] allows you to actually FM sounds like for instance sampled bass sounds similar

[12:48] to Ableton. Ableton also allows you to do that for example if I have a brass sound

[12:52] here

[13:00] so the way that I use that in my sound design is sometimes I'll create sounds

[13:04] that are normal right like a guitar like a brass shot I'm like use it as a brass

[13:08] shot however I always like to add mods for this stuff because as you can hear

[13:17] you can create some really crazy sounds with a sample getting a fanned from a

[13:23] saw like it's crazy to me like it's insane

[13:28] and this is when you would use a sub I always get asked a lot by people I

[13:31] wouldn't use a sub in production stuff so as a sound designer for me use a sub

[13:36] when you have a sound that you like the tone of but it's gonna be impossible to mix low

[13:40] and into it and even then let's say you were able to mix low and into it by the

[13:45] usage of a high shelf boost or a bell EQ there's always trade-offs when you're

[13:51] EQing when you're boosting by huge amounts you can cause your frequencies

[13:55] to last longer than it should which is what you will people will refer to as

[13:59] ringing frequencies right you can cause phase shifts with like extreme EQ

[14:04] phase shifts so a lot of the times you want to avoid that right and you avoid it by using a sine

[14:09] wave as your sub so we're gonna do that here we're gonna put it probably at the

[14:14] same sub range as this because if we look at the EQ there is sub frequency

[14:19] there but it's just not as good and it's also pulsating it's constantly moving

[14:23] which means that if we want that effect that works but if we want a constant low

[14:27] end to be felt in the car or in the club then we want to use a sine wave that's

[14:30] going to be playing

[14:34] now do I have to cut out the frequencies from this guy in order to do that no

[14:39] because what tends to happen with phase cancellation which is what most people

[14:43] want to deal with is it's relative to volume so what that means is that if the

[14:48] subs in this sound aren't as loud as the sub I'm about to put there's low risk

[14:54] and of canceling out and also if cancellation does occur right they

[14:58] cancel each other out it's not gonna be like a complete serial cancellation it's

[15:04] gonna be a very minimal one because the sub isn't as loud

[15:16] so now let's put some reverb

[15:31] I'm on a legato portamento I'm gonna have this increase there we go

[15:42] we're gonna add this crossfade

[15:48] that an LFO let's just get fancy with it the other one was fine but we're gonna

[15:51] add a bit of an LFO moving at a slow rate I really don't know what I want and

[15:55] in that scenario if I don't know what I want that's fine I'm just gonna use

[15:59] again the random curved here or the random flat and use the smooth feature

[16:06] okay the reaver by the way it's a clutch in the sense that you know we put it

[16:12] because it makes anything sound good so

[16:16] trolling these frequencies more since the sound moves around a lot we do want

[16:20] the extreme compression right that the serum to man of states this is so we're

[16:24] just gonna essentially change the tonality of everything by moving these

[16:27] guys up and down

[16:41] now as I create the sound I'm noticing there's a lack of mid-low

[16:47] in order to access those mid-lows I might try to look for another wavetable

[16:51] that's gonna allow us to to add them in like possibly a monster one that's gonna

[16:56] be static but that

[17:08] now too much I guess we could say there's a lot too much overtones on it

[17:13] right too much high-end so we're gonna use a low pass and we're also gonna use

[17:16] a high pass to move some of the low end from it

[17:56] see if there's any way to make the sound more interesting

[18:29] let's add a filter now that's gonna provide that interestingness to it

[18:45] well what bees let's make a bass so we can do the standard deep house bass as

[18:51] well with this and I'm going to show you guys some of the techniques here that we

[18:54] can use for example the FM can be modulated and a lot of FM since they do

[18:58] modulate it so the way we would do that is route envelope 2 which is going to be

[19:02] the more traditional route and then we're gonna have it just open up and

[19:07] then come back to a starting position to give us a nice punchy deep house-ish

[19:24] let's use PD itself

[19:46] random fade re-trigger

[20:00] I want to add like a slap delay to this very iconic of back in the day when we

[20:06] had you know EDX and all that good stuff

[20:20] another common technique is modulation of the pitches to add that pitch

[20:25] envelope shift that we did

[20:50] even I forgot to lower down the level of the second oscillator

[22:50] let's add this nice click layer to it I'm looking for something that gives

[22:54] this more of a feel of like it's botanical like it's a drum so we're

[22:58] gonna go with that conga try that let's make it wide okay now I'm gonna add OTT

[23:19] and when you add OTT it might turn into a slap house bass

[23:29] let's add some reverb to this

[23:33] that sounds nice

[23:36] reminds you of those botanical sounds so now and again we're getting crazy here

[23:40] because we don't really have an end goal what we're trying to create so that's why

[23:44] I'm like just going crazy which is again if you want to make precise sounds always

[23:47] have a strategy when you're doing sound design but here I'm just trying to show

[23:50] you guys all the little things I've learned over the years from studying

[23:54] some of my favorite sound designers and some of my favorite packs like Equinox

[23:57] sounds had this botanical pack that was really dope and I loved and they would

[24:01] use a lot of combs to get this sounding like this

[24:08] so now I'm gonna add this note so that it's key tracked

[24:28] such a beautiful sound right maybe we have to control the mid

[24:37] and the reverb of course let's go with like a convolution which we talked about this is a good

[24:43] example where I might want to use it because I want to make it feel botanical I'm looking for

[24:46] something that I can't get with this so let's see let's try the weird one

[25:09] so

[25:10] now let's say I want more high frequency on this then I'll open up the filter

[25:16] or increase the FM a little more

[25:51] so

[25:51] really nice sound so we made deep house bass we made a botanical pluck we made something like

[25:56] that I don't know what you would use that for I would work more on the mixing of it of course

[26:00] I would want it to sound a little bit more warmer and of course I would go back to my sound design

[26:05] and I would figure out why it sounds cold hey guys so this is going to be the complete guide

[26:09] to master serum we went over some of the advanced modulations found in the warp section and now

[26:14] you should be able to use them with confidence so experiment with them make sounds with them

[26:17] to see what they can do and most important of all have fun you guys take care and you

[26:21] guys have a great rest of your day
