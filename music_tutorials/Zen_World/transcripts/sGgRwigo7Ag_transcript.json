    "text": "First things first, the effects section of Serum 2 can be reached by just going here and clicking there. Pretty simple. A couple things to note here. On the left side you're going to see main, bus 1, bus 2. We're going to be talking about these guys in a second towards the end and then hopefully tomorrow we can make a video discussing the mixer so that we can get our buses working over time. But from here we're going to have the effects section. We're going to have presets now available for you by clicking here and these are going to be essentially rack chains. For instance, if I go into bus processing you can see a bunch here. There's some good ones here that I do like to use here and there. The main effects bus like the 7 Skies lead split. It does look like he can do the split. We got the Alice lead 1, 2, 3, Alice in Wonderland. We got the Duda and then we have all of these which we can load by just clicking and then you get the whole shebang. You can also save your own by clicking here. So in case you ever find yourself usually, you know, when you make a lead or a fat rack chain, then you can save it for yourself there. Okay. And you can see here I have a couple for myself as well. Also the Side Peat split bass processing. Okay. From there, if you're working here and let's say you start filling up this thing and you're like, you know, you're in the zone, you're like, I need more effects, I need more effects and this is getting in the way, then you can click in here and it will remove it for you. So, you know, get the awk out the way kind of vibe just in case you're in that flow state and you want to do that. So, okay. From there, we do have bus one, bus two. Like I said, we're going to talk about those towards the end, but in the mixer section, pretty much you have these buses that you can route stuff to that. So again, if you wanted to route something there from the filter, you can do that there and it will be routed into that bus where it will be hit with effects. Think of a measure of turn tracks in a sense. Okay. From there, we can start getting into the effects that Serum 2 provides for you guys. So we're going to right click. The first one we have is called Body. Essentially what this is, it's a frequency shifter that is named after an iconic pioneer. And I am quoting the manual here is named after Harold Bode. So essentially it's a frequency shifter. So the way I like to think about frequency shifters is that they literally, it's like pitching the sound, but it sounds very R2D2. It sounds very abstract. It's very experimental, but I'm going to show you guys some very clutch things that you won't see anywhere else. And it's fucking free here on YouTube. Can you believe that shit? First things first here, we have this mono input. I, to this day, don't know what it does. I mean, on the Serum 2 manual quote, enabled to route mono input to the module. I can turn that shit on and off with stereo sounds or with mono sounds. And to this day, I don't know what it does. Maybe one of you guys does. And if you do, then let me know in the comments, but don't give me the definition in the manual, please. From there, we have the shift, which is going to shift the pitch of your sound. So at a hundred percent mix, we're grabbing the sound and shifting it, but notice how it's not that good of a shift. It's not grabbing the full sound because to the right of that, we have the range of the shifter. So if I go high, you know, we get those R2D2 sounds. So the thing that this shifter has that the Ableton one doesn't is that range now, which controls how the range of this shift is going to be from the left to the right. That's why we have a percentage there. Okay. So the way I like to think of shifters, I'll give you guys some examples here, basic shapes, boom. You know, you're trying to do some cool stuff. We can route range controls, how much you can move this shifter by. Now to the right of that, we have a DIR, which stands for direction. In the center, according to Serum 2 manual, it causes both channels to go in opposite directions. So what I've found is it usually makes the sound wide. Okay. So let's shift. Wide. We're shifting to one side. And then here we have our width, used in conjunction with the direction knob, which specifies whether both channels up and down are used, or if only a single channel is used. So it makes kind of sense if you think about it, because if you have more than one channel, you get width. Now from there to the right, this does have a mono, I repeat, a mono delay, which can be activated here by increasing the feedback, which increases essentially the delay time. So the feedback, the amount of delay fed back into the boat shifter, which can produce pitch delays. So we're going to increase this. Let's sync it to one eighths, or one eighth dotted is nice. Okay. Now the balance is going to control the input mix between the down and up shifted signal. Remember the range is given as a range, so we do have left and right. But the thing at this is now we go to the right, you're going to hear the pitch effect on the delay. All right. Super nice, right? And to the right of that, we have a blur. Think of it as a smear. Okay. And what this is going to do is it's going to create chorus and wild flutter effects. So doesn't make it hit as hard. So that's what the blur does. So now if I were to create some, some keys here, let's say we grab some triangle waves to create some roads. Oh, and we run this in parallel. I rarely run it at a hundred and it's this experimental sound design. We're going to change the shift just a tiny bit. That's the chorus is an effect now that is going to duplicate the sound, the saw. So let me remove this and duplicate the saw into four voices. Two will go left, two will go right. The lay one will control either the left or right. Delay two will control either the right or left, whichever again, vice versa. So with the chorus effect, the sound is delayed. There is essentially a rate because something's being modulated, which is the delay time and the pitch. The depth is how much modulation amount we have. And then the feedback at high is to keep just increasing it at a high values. It gives a very metallic effect. But if I put it just right enough, you can hear there, you get this very nice B swarm type of sound. Now, the reason I would use a chorus over using detunement, dogs are going crazy out there, is because it sounds more retro. So if I ever wanted like a, like a detuned Juno sound, you know, a lot of guys are like, I need Juno, I need a Juno. There's also a filter, which you can use low pass or a high pass. Okay. So for instance, if you have a bass and you don't want this chorus applied to the low end because your team no thing below 150 goes wide, then my man. So, but let's say you hit it, but here you don't. So now you go down, we have a compressor, which is going to help with the dynamics of a sound. So compressor, it's going to help make you the sound more punchy, help control the sound over time, or help the sound become a more less punchy. And then from there there's other usages for it, of course. So for instance, here, I have a saw. If I put our attack high and low release, I can make it extra punchy. The attack is how fast it takes for the compression to come in. So that's why with a higher attack, you hear the transient of the, of the saw versus this just pushes it more in. And you know, that gain reduction, that volume reducement to go back to no reducement. We have a makeup game and then the ratio is how hard it's doing it pretty much four to one DB means that for every four DB that goes over the threshold, which is here, which is going to be what we use to kind of control the compression. Well, the ratio, the higher it is, the stronger that compression is essentially the more gain reduction we get in all the way to the right. We do get a limiter in this. Okay. From there we have the multiband mode, which for me, it's a bit weird in the serum to manual quote multiband device, the audio signal, and it's considered an extreme effect. So I mean, it sounds very EDM to me. The ratio does work here. You can see it changes the green and Brown bars, mainly the green. So the higher up again, the more it's compressing, like it sounds more natural, more tight. And there is a specific place for those kinds of sounds. Just keep that in mind. I don't like them personally, but certain people like them and they go crazy. When I show them this from here, we do have the attack and release, which to be fair, don't do Jack. Okay. I've tried it. And it's like, what is that for threshold here? You can see it works like this. Okay. We have the green, which I would, I would assume it's downwards compression, which is the compression we did before, but now on three bands. And then we have the Brown, which is pushing up, which is going to be considered upwards expansion, which the sound hits that or goes below. It pushes it higher up. So you have a very squashed on getting hit from the front and the back of sorority girl stream. Ha ha joke. Okay. So here we have an X low, which is just a crossover for the low frequencies. And then the X high, the crossover for the highs and whatever is set in between that is considered the mids here. So you can control that there. This is the ratio below. So the compression below the Brown one. So this is how it compressed here. The bottom is hitting that up there. Keep in mind too, that I can tone control the sound with this by pulling up and down. Think of it. So that's good. And you can also modulate these guys. If for some reason you want it to do it, now you can get freakier to the right of that here. We can make up. So if we, let's say push the lows in really nice and like, it sounds dope, but then it gets too quiet. You can make it up here. So that's where you're going to find that. And you still have a makeup overall. We have the convolved next with convolution. Reverb is going to be reverb the best way to put it. Let's say you're in a church. You're hearing the father just going, do we are salvation. You must approach the lady. She's there for a reason. Do not let your mind. And then you hear the reverb in the room. You're like, this sounds fucking nice. So you record the reverb and that's what we would call an impulse file. And we bring that in profiles into this thing. And this is going to try its best to give the sound, the characteristics, the reverb of the room that you've recorded. Okay. So we're going to have a couple here. So if we go long here, we're going to have the ABC rebel. Now with convolution, we have a couple of controls. The first is the size. The more the size goes up, the more stretched out your file gets. And obviously it gets longer and bigger. Like we pull it down, get shorter, tighter. Okay. To the right of that, we have a tone, which is going to pretty much you're applying a filter to your impulse file. And as you go up, it's brighter. As you go down, it gets more damp, more warmer, more swampy to the right of that. We have a phase, which is stands for convolution. Minimum face. If you turn it on, you hear here, there's sort of like this echo effect with it on a little tighter. It tries to control that. So you can have that on to get a tighter reverb. So the right of that, we have a pre-delay, which in essence, you can sync. So it's in beats mode here. So one eight, one four, it's the way you would use this as if you had a drum, let's say a clap. You wanted to clap to hit and then the reverb to come in after the clap hits. This is why you would use this makes it lag. For example, here, I'm going to put 1.4 seconds. I'm going to put the size low and I'm going to play. So that's what that pre-delay is for. And there's obviously very creative usages for it. Not for me. To the right of that, we have the attack and that is used to fade in the impulse file. And then we have the decay. So you can see how it changes here. To the right of that, we have a damp. The damp is going to damp the high end. So think of it like a low pass filter being applied to the high end. And below that, we have the volume of the impulse response. Think of it as a volume for the reverb itself. So for example, let's say I use this. And I go. Increase the volume of that. Increase the size. But this is where you would control that. Evolution, it's not all about producing a reverb. Sometimes you can produce interesting growls, like you can have the characteristics of a cow, of a goat. I'm not lying. There was one time I had to impress the sound the same class. I was like, I'm just going to use the good old goat trick. And let me tell you guys, once that goat growl came in, everyone just like that me weird like this guy. It's not right in the head. From there, we're going to have a delay inside of Serum 2. I'm fond of the delay. I think the delay is simple, but you can do a lot of really cool stuff with it. First off, there's going to be three modes to the delay. There is a high quality mode, which remember, high quality doesn't always mean good. Sometimes you want to go for a lo-fi effect, so you can definitely turn it off if you choose to. From there, we have normal, ping pong, tap delay. OK, so ping pong makes it so that you get the iconic, you know, ping pong effect. They're both at the same time signature, but that delay is going to play on one side first to create the width, because if they play at the same time, which is what normal does, it's going to collapse into the center, which there's nothing wrong with that. Usually you want to look at your song and see where your delay is going to sit best on the sides if it's not too busy and down the middle if the sides are way too busy. And then we're going to have a tap delay. Which. It's both delays to mono. OK, so so it is mono lo-fi, causing the left signal to fire once when no feedback. Tap followed by the right signal operating as a typical delay. Feedback is applied. So I guess the left hits first and then this delays this. Let's try it. There it is. After a bar. And then that is the right is hitting it. So now we learn something together, because I always wondered how this worked and I didn't really care. Here we have the feedback, which is the amount of repetitions. The higher the feedback, the more repetitions we get, in essence, the more echo we get. OK, so for example, I'm going to go normal. Low. At high, it self-oscillates. So be careful because it's going to get loud eventually. There it goes. So it can self-oscillate as well. Here we have essentially a filter. Which controls the tone of the delay itself, not the sound. Very useful for whenever you're trying to hit something. And you can also modulate that, which is a trick I use for my sound design. Changing. Let's do one half here. OK. Boom. OK. And then to the right of that, we have the mix and a level here just to keep that in mind. OK. And then we can switch between BPM and S mode. And if you wanted a dotted, you can lift this up to dot dot. And you get the dotted one eighth. The other thing, too, is if you, let's say, want to use normal mode, but you want a wide delay. And this is where you can offset one of the right or left by a few milliseconds to get the width delay. And then finally, MS, you can program a slap delay or create your own phaser. Or cone filter this way. From there, we're going to have distortion. And for this one, I'm going to put a sine wave because distortion is best explained with an innocent soul, which a sine is. It's just a fundamental. OK, so we're going to have a total of 13 types of distortions here in the mode you're going to be able to pick from the different flavors you have. You have tube, soft clip, hard clip, diodode, one, two, linear fold, sine fold, zero square, downsample, ASYM, rectify, X shaper, sine shaper, strongbox, tape saturation, overdrive and soft saturation. You have a lot. So I would say you sound the sine and play with them to see how they sound. Some of my favorite ones are going to be the tube. I'm going to make a bass. OK, I'm going to put another sine here, but up an octave. And now check this out, we're going to soft clip, hard clip, diodode one, move that or we can do this. OK, that's how you make those sounds if you've ever heard them. OK, so distortion is going to be affected by the volume of your sounds before it. That's what we call the pre-drive of it. Diodode one, very strong, squarey type of distortion. Then you've got diodode two, you can see the way the shape changes here because we are wave shaping this sound. OK, from there we have a linear fold. Let's lower this back down. OK, so here. Of course you can modulate that. We have a sine fold. Sine shaper, zero square. This is the strongest distortion, the zero square. It just fucking squares everything off. We have a downsample. It provides a nice little crunch effect, it's slowing down the bitrate. Very, very, very, when we make basses, I'll show you guys the rest bass that made her famous as shit. And yeah, yeah, the one million dollar bass, like the deadmau5 one. Asym distortion is different from the left, so that's usually asymmetric distortion. It's not fully like the same on both. This one's weird. Rectify. Then we have the x shaper, which is the one I wanted to get to to explain. So the x shaper, pretty much you're drawing in your own distortion. So you're shaping the sound to the left. You're going to go to your A and to the end when you create your B. Let's say I do this with B to the right. You create the B. So what the way I like to use this personally is creating movement and sounds with distortion. Okay. From there, if I go to Asym, we're pretty much grabbing the positive of whatever we'd created and putting it on the top right. And then the negative is going on the bottom left, I believe. So let me just make sure that's correct. Top right presents highest positive value to the signal and lower left represents the highest possible negative value. So I almost got it right. Right. But again, the way I see this is wave shaping. So I use this more for the movement. I find a lot of the times these definitions really don't help with the sound the same process. So sometimes I'll read them and go, oh, just distortion that I can modulate. From there, we have a sine shaper, which I like because this is actually pretty volatile. We can move this arrest because you can stack it, which I don't know why you might want to do that. The main reason I say that. Like is because. It usually in the digital world, this does not sound good stacking like that. That's my opinion on it. Soft saturation. OK, now a couple of things to note with distortion, there is a filtering section in the distortion here, which we would call a pre filter. So, for instance, let's say I have a saw. And I want to target more of the low end and I can pre filter before the distortion hits and. To create that, if I put it post, notice how it's different because that filter is being put after distortion. So this is what we're filtering. However, in pre, we create the sound because we're filtering the saw before it reaches the distortion. Similar to us putting an EQ before it. Like so. OK, so that's distortion. Very straightforward. We by default have a low shelf and a high shelf. Only two markers. We can set a bell, move it around. I'll give you guys an advice. The scale feature. And again, this is why Steve. Come on, man. Look, this is you're reducing here by seven DB, but it looks like you're reducing by two or three. Right. So it's crazy. So keep that in mind. So this is where we can EQ the sound, apply movement, create your own version of a notch if you wanted to. And if by clicking and holding all, you can have as many cues as you want. So you can definitely get your sounds mixed pretty decently before they exit serum. If you like the way that sort of system. From there, we have the filter similar to our filter section that we've already gone over. You can put the filters here. Let's say that you distort heavy and you're doing all this and you want to filter there instead of there, then you can do it. Or maybe you get too much high and you want to reshape the sound and you can do it. OK, so we're not really going to get into that filter because we are doing by clicking. From there, we have a flanger, the Paris Hilton effect. OK, that is how much modulation amount. Great speed feedback. Again, the volume of the effect itself and then the phase is going to LFO on the left and the right. So I believe if you move the face, you get stereo because you're pretty much let's say both LFOs are being routed to left and right voices like this. As you move this face knob on the right side, you might be altering it like this or inverting it. OK, and to quote again, the manner of the stereo offset for the LFO influence over the flanger, the left and right and the right flange offset, a setting of zero sets both left and right to the same frequency, a setting of 50 percent represents 180 degrees, meaning that the left and right have opposite frequencies. In this case, the flanger street prices on the left while falling on the right. So that's what we would use that for. So you're changing from there, we have the hyper slash I mentioned the hyper is a micro chorus effect, which, again, similar to the chorus, it's meant to increase the voices and detune them. And then you're going to have your rate of the detunement. And then you can reach it. So all the voices that you're creating start in the same position, giving us a stronger sound in the beginning. It also gives us a flange because he saws are just canceling each other out. They don't like each other there, but here everyone has this. So it definitely makes hyper sauce from there to the right. We have a dimension. It's a pseudo stereo effect consisting of four delay lines summed out of face and slowly amplitude modulated to provide a subtle motion to the effect. So by increasing the size, you are adding extra layer of face delays. But in essence, you're using this to create some width on the sound, which sounds like so like almost like a small room reverb, which I've never been a big fan of dimension expansion. I always think that it sounded a little too. Remember, we have a phaser similar to the phaser effects that we had here, except now we're actually using a real phaser effect because these filters are just static unless you're moving them. Same thing. This guy, you're going to be able to have four notches downs or ups the depth. How much how deep are they frequency center frequency that revolving the phaser around rate how much you're moving by and then feedback the sound of the effect. And then, of course, the face similar to the flash create with by having the left side be at a different place on the right. Phaser effects. And finally, from the phaser, we have the reverb where we're going to have new reverbs. I believe three at the plate, which is a two dimensional reverb. You got the width up. Usually plates tend to be boring. Your faint sound metallic. You have a pre-delay, which delays the reverb similar to the convolution and the damp to dampen the highs. Higher the size, more decay. And then we do have this EQ for this here. Low cuts before the sound reaches. I'm not too fond of this, though. It usually doesn't sound the best, but we'll talk about later. Then we have a hall. OK, usually more depth to a hall. I would say it's a more three dimensional reverb. We have a size for it. Higher size is usually darker, more in the back, lower, more in your face, more plate like we have a pre-delay again. You guys know what it does. There it is. And then we have a decay for it. And then we're going to have the spin. The spin is going to be modulating what I believe is the time. From there, we have a vintage reverb. But from here, we're going to have the low end, the high cut again to suppress low frequencies before, you know, so the reverb is going to not create them as much and also highs. From there, we have the size higher up again, more depth, lower, more in our face, more metallic pre-delay. Same as before, we have the ER size here, which is going to be the length of the early reflections part. Reverb. OK, so lower down the diffusions. And now from there, decay up and that diffusion A is the diffusion of the reverb and then diffusion B is to dampen it. So the damp is the rate at which high frequencies decay. It doesn't sound too shabby. Theoretically, this should sound like a delay because with reverb, it's technically delays if you think about it, but it gets diffused, aka it gets smeared. So if I'm talking to you right now and you hear my delay from my voice, then you won't really know what I said, but you will hear the tonality of it through the reverb. That's the idea here with diffusion. You smear it. And then your diffusion B dampens. And then the damp controls how fast or how slow the high end is going to decay. So to the right, it's allowing the high end to just take its sweet time and down. It's instant getting damp, almost in a room full of carpets and not getting that beautiful tail on the highs. Controls. The only thing that changes here is the feedback, which is the amount of reverb fed back into the input signal. Diffusion. We talked about it. It's how diffused the sound is going to be. So usually I run it a little high. Let's increase the size. There's a chorus effect now here. And I believe for the vintage, it was also a chorus effect applied to the reverb. So if you increase the depth, you can make it sound very lively. I really like this reverb. From there, we have five different modes here for this guy. And I remind you that we have a marble, pre-delay, diffusion, feedback. Size. Leave it high now around here. Add some depth, right? There we go. It's almost like delays that chorus puts in work, but you can hear it's almost like a delay and a reverb put together here, which creates some very beautiful effect there. And then finally, we have basin, which is a mono reverb. Very sensitive on the chorus. It's more like a B. But yeah, I don't know why this one's mono. Keep that in mind and then pre-delay feedback. Okay, we have the splitters. So we're going to have three in total, a low and a high. With this, we control the crossover so we can apply effects to the low band and the high band separate of each other. The reason you might do this is, say on the high band, you want to add a body. So you can do that on the high. Like so. And if I omit it, the lows does not get hit by it. I can control the crossover here and then the volume here. There's the low end. Low end. Bring this up. Now on the highs. Okay, and then this is the crossover for that. So you're going to have the low-high, you're going to have low-mid-high. So you can target each one individually. And then there's, I believe, one more, which is a mid and a side. So mid is going to be down the center. So I'm trying to see how I can show you guys that. So let's put in effects here and decrease the volume. So this is the mid and the sides is going to be this. Check it out. What's on the side. So more heard on the side of your headphones. Wide versus center. Okay, so you're going to have access to that as well. And finally, you have a utility where you can mono the bass. See, Steve also believes in everything below. He believes everything below 90 hertz should be a mono. From there, we have a width knob. We have a pan knob, width to increase the width. We have a utility high-pass filter, low-pass filter. We can invert the polarity on the left side or on the left and right together. Okay, and then from there, we have the mix for that and the volume. All right, by right-clicking there, at the bottom, we have effects bus. So we can do a lot here. For example, let's say that I come in with, I don't know, the same world screech processing. Oh, yeah, yeah. Mainly meant to be used with this. Oh, yeah, yeah. Lower the volume. So now I can right-click effects bus and I can lock the effects bus. So as I go through presets, the effects box will stay. I can also lock all effects buses, which I believe will lock the bus one and two as well. But with that being said, that is the effects section of Serum 2. Now, of course, we have the main, which is going to be by default always working, but the bus one and two will only work when you use, go to the mixer and you route from here. Then we're going to make a separate video for the mixer, even though it feels like it's very self-explanatory, to be fair. But we can route the sound here or we can filter the sound before we route it to the bus one. Now, keep in mind, if I route it through here first, I'm routing the saw sound without the filter because we're creating a different auxiliary channel. So this is being routed here and it's also going to the main because we have it routed there. So keep that in mind with that. The busses. And also right click here, as you guys know already, and route to filter two or to the direct out to the main. From there, if we don't want to route it just directly to a bus, we put it on none. So that way nothing's coming out and we route it to bus two and now it comes out through there. Bus two we can also set to direct to bus one. Hey, we didn't need to make a video for this section after all. And we can control the volumes here. And here we have filter one to envelope one on, just determines if this oscillator runs through envelope one, which I think it should because then it sounds way too static. You can see there. That's what we use that for. So we have it there up here now when it's on now, but since we have it routed to the filter, it's set over there. All right. So let's make a couple of sounds. The first one I want to make is a rest style bass we were talking about. So, you know, we're going to create a basic saw. I'm going to turn on this arp and we'll talk about this in another video, but I just want this, this trip dot or whatever. And then we're going to do this. We're going to add a down, essentially a distortion. Down sample. You can use a pulse if you want to mute it a bit. So let's switch the song maybe to another one. Make some beefy. And then we just modulate this. Let's apply a reverb to the high end. Just to make it sound a little more alive, maybe a little bit of an echo. Ping pong it so it doesn't sit on top. It needs to be a little longer. If you want, we can add an OTT. We're going to make the bass a little more modern. Playing with the ratio at the bottom, crossovers. Now let's make a wave shape sound. So we're going to be using sine waves and saws or any basic shape to create something very dope. So let's go with C0 for our bass or C2 actually, minus two. I'm already going to come in with some heavy distortion. I'm going to come in with a diode. So now I'm going to play with this. I'm going to put an LFO on the fine to create that effect we did earlier today. We're going to envelope it. We can inverse that. We can add some movement here. Cool. Try a seventh. That sounds pretty cool. So we can do a lot with that. We can also create some recess. There we go. Trying to get some wide. And then why not distort one more time. Let's see if we can add a chorus effect. Or a DAB ratio. Let's put an EQ. OTT. I don't know what I'm doing to be fair. Mono legato. We'll talk about that later. Let's put the EQ before the distortion to pre-filter a bit. Let's try adding a phaser. All right, we're entering that. Let's do a one voice. That sounds dope, right? I don't know why I'm gravitating more towards wubs. Maybe I've been missing making the wubs. But let's see. I'm starting to think maybe we can make a nice little lead sound. Let's use the expressive chords. Let's add a bit of release. Okay, go with a filter. Okay, now some effects. Just make something that sounds dope, right? Reverb. Let's experiment with the stuff we don't really use, like the vintage. Let's apply a Bode. See what we can do with it. Blur. Move that up. There we go. Before. Signal flow is very important. We can move the effects like so. Let's increase the steps. Let's move the LFO up. Slowly evolve it so that it's nice. Mono input. What does it do? I don't know what it does to this day. Oh, I love that. But this delay is not working. It's way too busy. There we go. Now this shift, when we moved it, it had a beautiful effect. Let's do it. There it is. That's it. That's it. Let's apply some high. More blur. Love that. Very simple song. Let's make this a lot tighter. Some echo. Let's make a vibrato lead. This one we use an LFO here. Fast. Let's apply a supersaw to create like an EDM lead. Let's apply a distortion. See what happens. A little too much. Let's go with a soft saturation. I believe we have that at the table. Apply a bit of release. A bit of too much distortion because of the lingering release when they overlap. And with distortion it sounds a little bad. Yeah, that's pretty nice I would say. Let's apply reverb. Again, I don't know why I still have the depth set too high up. Let's apply a plus one. Make it feel like climatic. Let's EQ. Oh, we can do that. Remove lows. Let's create a gated lead. We're going to grab this down, do this to each one in particular and shift like so and holding shift here it's going to do that. Pull it back. So we can also use a sine LFO Yep, to create that. Create that. Oh yeah, we can create a offbeat bass now. So the way we would do that is an LFO, pull on the level, do that. We're going to use a filter. This we're going to distort. And now we pick a good shape that maybe gives. And we also have it. Oh, we didn't want to do that. I'll click, boom, copy that on the wave. But now I'm going to do that. It gives us a very nice kind of good start. I'm gonna increase the high end if I can. That's what it's missing. So in sound design, sometimes with the EQ you might have to do crazy boost. It's more of a sound design thing because you're trying to get a certain part of the sound out. Let's go to 140. I wonder if I can put a 909 kick here now with a sample mode. But now I need it to hit every one fourth and that's the hard part. Then we're going to process the kick further too. I'll show you guys how to do it. And now the kicks being routed to the distortion. So I'm going to route it to none. I'm going to route it to bus two. Let's do the same here so I can show you guys. Bus one, none. So now bus one is the bass. Make sure we're not routing to the main. That's why I don't want to direct out, direct out. There we go. So now they're separate. Let's get rid of that. So now we have the bass, which I'm going to use in bus one, I believe. You can see the routing here. Yep. And then we have the kick in bus two. And if I want to process everything together, I can do it in the main. All right. So for instance, the kick, let's say I want to distort that kick further. I can. And bus two. Right at the end there, I might EQ the kick further. I need more high end. Then we can control the volume. And then let's see if we can get this right. Controlling the kick. On the bass, we're going to add an OTT. And then again, a utility for the volume. Control here. And now we control here. And then we pull down. And now we're at. This is hard. It's very raw. I'm doing like a Lucas Prestoli style of kick. Not sure we might ever want to do it like this, but. Let's try making a melodic techno stab now, we're going to go into the analog and we're going to grab the matrix C64. We're going to use a filter. Envelope three. Let's increase some unison. Something like that. Let's add maybe two, another few voices. To capture more frequency spectrum and then go with another one of these. We'll go with that, save time. And let's use like a sine folder, sine shaper on it. Choose a pre, remove some of the lows. The cue. And some reverb and delay. Let's use Hall. Also add it here to the drive. Just to show you guys a bit of how it would eventually sound like after playing with it for a while. The key for me is always to get everything to sound like this. But to get this, you know, that's like the next level part of it, it takes a little bit of time and effort. As you can see, I did do a bit of pre-cue. I hope that it was very useful for you guys and I hope that it gives you ideas on what you can do with the effects section. So with that being said, I'll catch you guys in another video for the complete guide to Master Serum. Keep killing it guys and let's keep going, okay? Much love and take care.",
