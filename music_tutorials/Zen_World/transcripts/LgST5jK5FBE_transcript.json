    "text": "Beep, beep. When Serum 1 first came out, one of the biggest reasons why I got down on my knees and, you know, I bend the knee, as they say, and gave it the ring and made it my main synth of choice, my main boo, was because of its LFO section. At the time when it came out, I had never seen such a freeing LFO where I could just draw shapes and make knobs move in ways that I never thought was imaginable. And, you know, I feel this is one of the reasons why when you ask drum and bass and dubstep producers, anything with, like, complex sound is saying, what's the favorite synth of choice? Many of them will say Serum because it allows you to do stuff that no other synth could do. Now, of course, we've had synths that have tried to mimic it and been inspired by it, like it's Bastard, it's like Vital and all that, but to this day, it's one of the things that makes Serum 2 probably one of the best synths out there for creating very complex sounds. And today you're going to learn it. All right. So the LFO section in Serum 2, there's going to be a lot of LFOs. And as you start using them all up, let's say you make a sound where you're using all six, it starts to give you even more and more. So you could possibly say it's an unlimited amount of LFOs in this. Now, LFO, for those of you guys that want to impress your friends, stands for low frequency oscillators. I guess at the back in the day, you know, as you guys know, analog synths were created by using electricity. You know, they would use electricity to make sounds. And I guess you had these low frequency oscillators below 30 Hertz that they were like, we don't know what to do with it. So I guess someone had the idea of possibly saying we could move knobs with it. We could move knobs with it. And the LFO was born. So we can drag and drop the LFO to the level of this saw sound here. Let's add a bit of unison in Serum 2, man. And we can hear it work. To create this nice flutter beating sound. Now, with every LFO, you're going to have the rate, which is the speed of the LFO. Right, super nice. We already sound pro as heck, right? So, you know, with most LFOs, you're going to have them synced up to the BPM of whatever you're doing and then you're going to have your rate of 116, 1 8th and so forth to the right here. You can also use your trip or dot in order to activate the hippie modes or the the weird modes, which are the modes I rarely use, to be fair. Like, you know, you have a 1 8th dotted, which can work for certain songs. Like if you guys watch Demon Slayer, that movie, you know, on Netflix that got big, the main sound golden. If you wanted to make something like it or the or the rhythm of it, you would have to go into, I believe it's a triplet style. Of foray, because I think one of the sounds that was in that soundtrack, because I remade it, don't ask why. I had to do that in order to get it. So there are usages for it. However, the more popular way is just going to be like so. From there, we can also switch the LFO into Hertz mode, which again, we talked about where low frequency oscillators, what they are, right? You can see 0.3 Hertz. So this is how fast it's moving based on Hertz. And as you notice, as I go from the left to the right, you know, you don't hear no big jumps. Right. And that's what this is useful for. But whenever I want to modulate something that's not synced to the BPM or I want to create some randomness or I want to create a pitch drift effect, this is what I would use in order to achieve that, to add movement to a sound that's not predictable. OK, from there. And Serum LFO is pretty easy to use. We have the mode we're in. We're going to have here this submenu, which we can go into where we have basic rhythmic sidechain, random curve, random flat, and the basics is where you're going to find the standard LFOs you would see in most synths, saw down curved, which we want to saw down. We're going to have flat, which resets that, saw down, saw up. A sine, which is like almost like a wiggle square to create like these pulsing type of sounds. And in a triangle, which is very smooth, one of my favorites. And then from there we go into this rhythmic section where you're going to have more complex LFOs that are user generated. So what that means is these are made by you, by someone. Some people sell presets for these. So if you ever wanted to do a little side hustle, you could sell LFO presets. And then from there we have sidechain as well, which these sidechain shapes, which I think are going to come from the LFO tool. All right. From there to the right, we also have the way that the LFO is going to move. It's going to forward. We'll start from here, move there, come back. We have reverse. It starts from the end. So if I put this on a level and then we have ping pong where it goes to the end and then the reverse is back. To the right of that, we can control the grid size of this. You can go really high, really precise. And you have your X and Y axis controls here. The reason this is very important was because let's say you're creating something and you want to, let's say, make your own. But you want to make this saw have a certain beat or sync up to something. Then we can use these because by holding option click, we can have the dots attached to the grid. And I want to create a web here down the middle. If I don't have that grid, I'm going to increase the grid size going across. And now I can do that. Boom. And then I can lower this down by option. I'm clicking right now. You can see I can also control the slopes like so. Now, if we hear this. OK, let's switch it to forward. We're going to have the LFO modes here for this particular style of LFO, or I believe they might say the same, but free makes it so that this is free flowing. And so if I play and I play again, you can see it's continuing the journey and it's going to keep moving. If I retrig it, you're always starting from the beginning. Now, one thing to note in free, which I really love with the Serum LFO is that right now you can see in the whole section here it's turned on. So this is synced to the to the to the host right now to your BPM. But what you're going to find here, which is super cool, is that if I play, let's say something here, this is still going to stay synced to whatever we have going on here to this rate. But now we're going to be able to add the movement. We have retrig, which we talked about. We'll always make it start from the beginning no matter what. And then we have envelope mode, which is going to make this play once and it's not going to repeat. And then it's going to stay wherever that last dot is. Like so. Now, the cool thing about this is you can also make it loop. And in this scenario, there is a bit of a good strategy to use here. For example, I could have this go here and I could right click and then I have all these settings here, which we're going to talk about in a sec. But I can set loopback point here. So this makes it so that we do everything and then we just keep looping in this little circle. The reason this is useful is you might have a track where, you know, you play on the one and you want it to do bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. Now, if I start every note at a different time. Eventually they'll sync up, but you can see. Here I have four notes I'm playing and it sounds like an arp. An arp. It's just that every voice has its LFO and they're all starting at the beginning because we have mono set up, but if you wanted them all to sync up. Then we would activate the mono. To the right of that, we're going to have these settings here, rise, delay, smooth and the phase. I would rise. We're going to have the LFO start at whatever value you set here. So if I put it down, you're not going to hear it. But if I put it here, you're going to hear it there. But what it's going to do is the shape, the modulation it's going to be doing, it's going to be slowly applied based on the speed you set here. So this becomes useful for when you have a sound where you want to play a chord and then you want it to wiggle at the. For example, I'm going to set it to four bars. You can hear how it's slowly coming in to the full modulation, right? It's giving us a full flutter there. The delay delays it fully, so it doesn't even start until the time you've set has passed. From there, we have probably one of my favorite things that is new in the Serum LFO, which is going to be the smooth. This is going to smoothen out the the modulation, making it not sound as I guess you could say, if you have a very jagged one, a very transidy one, it would round it out more, making it sound a little bit more flowy, more smooth, as the name says. For example, if I go here and I use like a crazy like this, I can. Smoothen it out. And you can also see what it does. One way I like to use this mode is by going here to random or random flat. I'll activate that and then I'll smooth it out to make somewhat of a wub depending on whatever this decides to generate for me. And then from there, I'll do this. And now I have this great waveform for a wub that I wouldn't have thought of. It makes my life a little easy. You can see that I have that. We can also use the random flat, which is which square gives us a random squared off. I like using this one with the grid size, of course, because then from there we can create stuff that sounds like it's in beat if we ever decide to put in a kick. Let's go one more time. From there, we have the phase, which decides where we start out at the LFO section. OK, and then from there, we're going to have these little settings here that you can see the coordinate point dot system is the one we've been using. Just doing that, depending on the grid size, these next ones are going to apply it based on the grid size you have set. So they're going to be determined by that and how long they're going to be. Here we have a flat. We have a slope up. If we wanted to add that, notice how it locks into the bottom part there and it stays within each little box. So if I increase this like so, you're going to see that now we're going to have more of. So from there, we also have a slant, a slant down. OK, and then from here, we can click here to open this up more. I'm pretty sure you can probably make it bigger or not. And now you're going to be able to get very precise with what you do. Or in case you ever wanted to see LFOs up close. Well, now you can tell people that you have seen LFOs up close. We have a lot of new LFO modes, by the way. Back then we we didn't have access to these four here. All right. So the next thing we have is path. I rarely use this one, but pretty much the the theory here would be to create a path. Again, we're still going to be controlling the the knob, but we're using a different system for it where we can draw nice shapes. If you choose to. I'm not sure we can draw a heart, but let's say I do something like this. All right. Let's say there. Now I have an X and Y axis, so that's going to control again how we're going to change knobs across the X or Y axis, depending on where we're at. So I might want let's say let's get creative with this. We're going to pick another another wave table here. Let's pick a monster. Our X is going to control the wave table. Let's add an alternate warp here, a band minus plus to give it that. And our Y is going to alter that. And let's go slow. Let's add another dot. OK, and I'm pretty sure they're going to have some shapes and someone took time to make that a nice little flower. I don't know if there's a serum. I guess that's fine. I don't have that much time, though, I'm trying to make some bomb sounds, right? But whoever made these cool, man. Another way we can use this is also to create what I would call the sounds that sound like they're revolving around your head. X controls the level. Y will control the pan. So it looks like, yeah, we have access to these where we can close the circles, I believe, but then we have one that just leaves them open. So that's going to be the system. If you right click as well, you can modulate any of the coordinate points, which is something I didn't specify. You can do this in all the modes, by the way, except the last three that we're going to go over. For instance, I can modulate this with LFO 2. And one usage for this for me personally is just to create randomization. So it doesn't always sound the same. And also when I make presets, sometimes I want to wow my users. Right. So I'll do like modulations and they're going to be like, how the heck did he do that? So in a sense, it also adds the wow-ness factor. Like if you ever are in a session with a big producer that invited you to make music and you want to blow his mind in a good way, you know, not in that way. We know that goes happens a lot. You know, how did some people get to the top? Anyways, you could do some, you know, you can do some of those parlor tricks there and have fun. Maybe draw their name. And next thing you know, they offer you a release on their label, the Chaos Rossler and a sample and hold. So the Chaos Lawrence and Rossler. I'll be honest with you guys, I don't know what they do, but they're going to use the same system as the past X, Y. It's going to be crazy hectic. It's going to be based on the rate as well. We can slow it down. The way that I've used it, however, is to create pads that sound again, I guess the word would be binaural pads that sound like crazy movement that isn't predictable, that sounds different than using traditional LFOs. So, for example, let's grab a nice, a nice little wave here like this. And let's route this X to the level. We're not going to go all the way down. Alt shift click. We're going to make it bipolar, call the therapist. Then the Y here acts as well. Now let's play this. And let's go a little more crazier, pull it up more. And also that Y here and let's go faster, actually, Hertz mode. I mean, that's just crazy. It's like. It just randomly goes in a fast. You create these very cool sounds that are very, I guess, dreamcore, I guess is the word I'm trying to use. I really don't know my genres, but I got to catch up.  almost granular like as well. Then, you know, try it out. X. You know, let's add our envelopes. From there again, the chaos, Lawrence and roster, I'm going to assume they're going to move differently. Looks like the roster moves in a circle here. So it's going to let the aliens know that they can land or something. But let's find another really nice or nice, I don't know, wave table there. Let's let's let's let's keep it like, you know, proper here, fam. And I make sounds that sound to, you know, you know what I'm trying to say. If you want to give Noisia a run for their money, it's like, God damn, how'd you make that sound? And now, you know, and then, you know, maybe we'll wrap more stuff in here. Let's see how it works. X on this. I mean, that's nasty, man. But again, if I was making drum and bass, I'd be like, you know, it's just like I found the sound of the youth. All right. Below that, we have the sample and hold, which is going to be more of a generative style of LFO that gives you squared off squared off modulation, similar to where if we were to go on normal and do this old shift or I don't even know what I'm doing there. Go dot shift boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Now, these types of modulations are going to sound kind of a bit sample and holdish. I guess that's what I'm trying to say, where it sounds like this. But not as nice, like more like noise. Slow it down a bit. OK, but now you have a generative one that gives you random and I'm going to show you guys something clutch here that can create generative sounds here. So but the way I'm going to do it, I'm going to grab a spectral LFO, I'm going to route it there to the wavetable. And it's going to create this. I believe we can zoom in and out as well with these. But now if we use the smooth, we can smooth it out and now we have more of these curves. Now we can generate essentially a lot of growls with these crazy shapes. You know, let's add a distortion here, actually, and you'll see what I mean. This is going to get crazy real fast, fam. Again, you can lock BPM, lock this, so if you ever find something cool. Add another one, like bend minus warp or something there. Let's see. That's two, let's stack so we cover more range. And also add another one generative, of course, a bar and smoothing it out. Let's get rid of this. There and let's do the anima thing. Round it out. And then from there, I just want to make sure we hit everything. But I think we have that is the LFO section. Now, like I said, the more LFOs you use, let's say I decide to be fancy here. Boom, just hit everything. You know what I mean? I don't know. Then as I boom, I get more LFOs here. Look, look at that, man. I don't know if we get more than that. Let's just keep sending it to stuff, see what happens right now. Now, I think we get a max of 10, as you can see there. So with that being said, it's time to make some sounds. The first sound we can make is a very nice deadmau5 based sound because, you know, everyone thinks LFOs, they think of deadmau5. We're going to use a low pass filter, MGLO 2 with a saw. This filter is or this sound is the one million dollar sound, I would say, because it definitely made deadmau5 very rich. Now, of course, I'm not taking away from his musical composition side because the man made amazing music. And, you know, if we put this here, one eight, let's set our BPM to one twenty eight. Put some reverb. OK, now I'm going to use this chord feature inside of Ableton and I'm going to use the scale feature to do a minor chord. My thought process is we have these sounds that are staple, right? These are iconic sounds that when you use them, people like it because it's familiar and they're proven to work sounds, which means that they've been used to make amazing music. The problem with those sounds is as a sound designer, I can't keep selling, right? I can't keep creating those sounds and supplying them. So how do I reinvent the wheel? A lot of the times I reinvent by just using the same sound, but just layering on top of it. For example, let's use a wavetable here, just to give you a simple example. And we're going to use the prime. I don't know how it sounds, but we're going to respect this sound. And this is going to be a wide layer that's going to sit on top of it, maybe one octave up, lower the volume. And let's play that, and now we get that nice layer. And maybe the octave is going to switch, be generative. Let's use the sample and hold. This is, by the way, a new concept here. I don't know if it's going to work, but it's just something I was like, you know, I'm here with you guys and we're chilling, we're vibing, making dope sounds, so it might work. Let's make it a little louder. We can use something else, like a scale. Right, we can route it to its own filter as well. Filter 2 now, and we can have it do, with an LFO, just keep coming up like this. Let's go monster. Let's give it other chords. I want to create a wub that's going to do, sound a little more better than what we did with the envelopes, so we're going to be able to actually shape it differently. Let's slow it down a bit. And now we can square it off. We can add an LFO, which is going to move it up and down, maybe like, go. And we're going to activate envelope to make it just, again, repeat once and that's it. A little too high up, we can move it down. Let's lower this down. Let's add maybe two voices of unison. There we go, we're going to use a filter, let's also distort it here. With, let's try a sine shaper. And now on the LFO here, I'm going to overcomplicate this. I'm going to do a cool pattern for it. I'll click boom there like this, but let's modify this to be maybe different. Now let's give this filter at the end. We can go click here, make it go to filter 2. That way filter 2 goes to the main and then let's apply filter 2. One of these crazy filters that we love. There we go, let's add a sub now to support the sound. Direct out on it or main is fine. We don't want it routing to a filter. If you want this to follow the sound, then you can create this here to the level so it follows. And then as well here to this guy so that there's change of volume. From there we can also use the noise and do it to the noise there. Let's use the geyser to add a bit of a crunch to the sound. Go into color, geyser. Let's widen it. That's sick, isn't it? Noise. Now let's see if we can find something a little cooler. Maybe like the ring monster or the formants are cool, I know that. Let's try a band reject. Switch to LFO. Slower down the level of the geyser. In tech house we get that sound. So we can do that one very easily right now. Go into the filter, we're going to use an LFO. Just play one note. We're going to hurt. Now let me show you guys here with envelopes you can modulate anything. So one popular thing to modulate would probably be. This rate to have it go from up to down. So I can drag it here, we're going to the max amp. And we're going to lower down the envelope sustain. We can still hear it because it's being routed to both. So let's do this. Now we can play chords. Let's do something that they would do in melodic techno. Use the sound here, maybe put it at 1% or 2%. And let's just have it go. Like so. Another cool thing to do with LFOs is apply a bit of a pitch strip. So the way I'll do that is grab the LFO, put it on the fine here. And then I'll add this nice little envelope change.   We're going to free it. And we're going to lower down the amount and the speed a bit. Let's add another saw. Detune them slightly and do the same exact thing. So let's grab a multi-sample. And now we can create gated sounds a lot easier. So we can grab a choir sound like an ah. Both. And we can add it here. The level. I'm going to apply a bit of a sustain release. I'm going to shift, hold and do some nice sounds here. Mono it. Saw. We're going to use a filter. I'm going to add a high resonance. And when I play this I want the filter to move to the right. So we're going to move it like so. But I also want it to gate a bit. So I'm going to create more of a micro modulation with the LFO 2. And we're going to do it like this. And now we create that. We can also create that while hitting here and going into a sample. So I'm going to hold and just generating random every 8. You can also switch this to a band pass. Now let's fine tune this guy, pull it back. The blue modulation amount. Some noise. Now we can add unison. You can make something like that where it's slowly coming in. Then we're going to do this. Now we can use this as an envelope here instead of an LFO. Apply release so the LFO continues giving us that nice... Let me show you guys a cool trick here with our envelope. If we lower down the... Just go straight down and increase the sustain. On this guy, put it on here. But let's put this down to where we want to go. Or up to where we want to go. And pull it down to where it's zero. Here. Let's apply a lot of release. Now we're going to hear that sound. Here. We need to get some of these voices to pan left and right. Let's use the chaos now. The pan there. I wonder if I play multiple notes what happens. I'm going to increase the polyphony. I really like that. That is one of the coolest effects I've heard. So that concludes the section for LFOs. And as you guys saw, we can do a lot of really good, crazy stuff with LFOs. But the most important thing to think about LFOs is constant movement. The difference between envelopes and LFOs is that  Envelopes and LFOs is going to come down to the fact that LFOs can loop. As long as you're holding down a note. And they will continue to do what they're doing if there's any form of release on the sound. But as you saw, it makes it easier to make more interesting wabs. You can do crazy things with it. So definitely try it out guys. And with that being said, I'll catch you guys next time for another video. You guys have a great rest of your day and I hope you're enjoying this series.",
