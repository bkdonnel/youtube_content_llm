================================================================================

[00:00] Hey, what's up, ninjas?

[00:01] Today we are going into the sections that I'm not going to lie, puzzle me a little bit.

[00:05] I was like, why do we need a clip mode inside of Serum 2?

[00:09] Why do we need an ARP inside of Serum?

[00:11] Well, that one we definitely need it.

[00:13] But the clip and then the oscillator mapping was also a bit of an iffy for me.

[00:16] But today I will demystify it all for you because this is a complete guide to Master Serum.

[00:20] Clip mode for me is an opportunity to show everyone that uses my sounds

[00:24] how the sounds are intended to be used.

[00:26] For example, here we have one called the Busta, which is going to have this clip set.

[00:40] OK, now a couple of things to note here with your clip mode,

[00:45] you can access the clip section bottom left here by right clicking.

[00:49] You can lock it in case you wanted to lock it, but also MIDI input trigger octave.

[00:53] Essentially what these things are doing here, the ARP and the clip

[00:56] and why there's a keyboard down there is because after a certain octave range,

[01:00] let's say C Syrup, everything you play down there starts to sound theoretically

[01:04] kind of like too low for any comprehension of tonality.

[01:09] You know, stuff down there won't have melody, etc.

[01:12] So, you know, programs like Kontakt, Native Instruments

[01:16] use the bottom section to switch between different playing modes of different,

[01:21] you know, let's say string libraries they might have.

[01:23] So in Serum 2, however, those bottom ones like C negative 2

[01:27] is going to switch between the different clips you have

[01:30] and between the different ARPs you have.

[01:32] The next thing is you're going to have access here to some banks

[01:35] so you can create banks for yourself.

[01:36] You can save clip banks, which is going to save all of this.

[01:39] You're also going to have here like some factory banks like the Duda Chords,

[01:43] Neo Chords, for instance, here that you can go.

[01:47] Now you can switch between and if you can tell there's something

[01:50] that right now that's making it just stay there,

[01:52] it's not moving from the left to the right, and we'll talk about that in a sec.

[01:57] But in essence, that's where you're going to find the bank here.

[01:59] All the different clips you can have and you can make some for yourself,

[02:02] for instance, one of the things you can put in here if you wanted to

[02:05] is like rolling bass patterns or or patterns for house music,

[02:09] patterns for trance and so forth.

[02:11] OK, you're going to have trigger mode here, which is mono or poly.

[02:14] This is going to pertain to essentially your your clips.

[02:17] Can you play more than one clip at the same time?

[02:19] So I'm going to lower down the volume just a tiny bit here.

[02:22] And play.

[02:25] You can see it's just kind of like switching between all of them.

[02:29] But if I said poly.

[02:35] And they can all play at the same time, and maybe there's some magic there.

[02:39] Maybe there's not.

[02:40] So we have the clips there.

[02:42] So that's what this is for.

[02:43] And it all is going to make it so that we can edit all of the clips

[02:46] that are found here with these settings down here that we're going to be going

[02:50] through. OK, now below that, we have clip settings now, individual clip,

[02:55] right, each clip individual.

[02:57] So the bank is the overall and then you have clips inside of it.

[02:59] And as you go between them,

[03:01] you can see here that you can change certain things about them.

[03:04] OK, and edit all can alter that.

[03:06] From there, you have the length, which is how long your intended clip is going to be.

[03:11] To the bottom of that, we have the keyboard span,

[03:14] which is just going to pertain to essentially.

[03:18] If I play, let's see a clip.

[03:26] I can pretty much transpose the clip play.

[03:31] Again, on the keyboard, God damn, my ears are bleeding, man.

[03:33] Hopefully you guys are OK.

[03:36] Essentially, I can transpose it, so I have two options for that,

[03:39] and then I can also offset it, offset it.

[03:41] Each note that I play is going to make it start at a different section.

[03:44] So the way I see that is it's a cool way to kind of play a clip,

[03:48] you know, like randomizing.

[03:49] A lot of people don't usually make music and it always sounds the same.

[03:52] So some people will record themselves playing

[03:54] and then randomize the way it plays or they will reverse it

[03:57] so that they get something different that they wouldn't have thought of.

[04:00] They record for progressions and then randomize it

[04:03] to get different progressions out of the progression,

[04:05] because, again, we fall into habits.

[04:06] And these are all ways and strategies of breaking the habits.

[04:10] OK, from here, we can transpose it by one or two.

[04:13] And you're going to notice this number is changing because I have edit all.

[04:16] You can see they're all changing.

[04:17] But if I just lower that down, you can see that now only the individual

[04:21] one is changing. So if I said edit all and I reset the controls,

[04:24] hopefully they all change with that boom, like so. OK.

[04:28] From there, below that, we have what I would call one of the more

[04:33] unique things about this system that Serum 2 provides,

[04:36] which is the way that it's playing.

[04:38] So, for example, here, we're going to play this real quick.

[04:44] OK, so normal mode, normal, we can reverse it.

[04:48] We can pendulum it, which means that it's going to hit the end

[04:51] and then it's going to reverse into itself.

[04:54] We can also increase the rate,

[04:55] which I'm going to do just to kind of go through these multiple quick.

[05:01] There you go, that's pendulum.

[05:02] We have random, which is going to just jump all over the place.

[05:05] We have random, no duplication.

[05:08] OK, so obviously it's not going to duplicate unless after it's played

[05:11] all of them, we have random start.

[05:20] Let's play it from the beginning.

[05:27] Random ending and let's move this here a little to the right.

[05:34] And then we have the one shot, which will just play the whole thing,

[05:36] and then we have static,

[05:38] which is going to make it so that you only play the first note combination.

[05:41] So if I play, let's say this, it's only going to play the beginning of it.

[05:47] And this is useful because if you go back to the chord section here

[05:51] where Steve Duda provided all these chords,

[05:53] they're all set to static.

[06:00] And the idea of them, again, is going to be.

[06:04] Again, you just get to go between the chords,

[06:06] so it makes it useful because that way the clip isn't moving to the right

[06:09] and then you lose the chord.

[06:10] And then from here, if you remember, if we select the keyboard,

[06:13] span them on and play.

[06:17] Yeah, you can play, you can transpose the chord up or down, but.

[06:24] Each one's going to have time signatures here,

[06:26] which is going to be just the beats, one fourth, one eighth,

[06:29] how you divide everything up by below that, we have the speed, which is the rate.

[06:32] So we can go twice as fast and we can also go into the subdivisions

[06:36] of triplet and of dotted as well.

[06:38] And then we have the quantization on the launch,

[06:40] which is going to have to deal with how it syncs up.

[06:42] Then we have the returns, Velo return and return,

[06:45] which is going to mean every time we switch a note.

[06:47] How is this clip going to react the way that I personally use the clips?

[06:50] A lot of the times for me, it's going to come down to making the sound

[06:53] and then giving an example of how I intend the sound to be used.

[06:58] For example, there was this track

[06:59] that MK did that got a shit ton of streams with the sound.

[07:08] What you guys should know how to do by now,

[07:11] because you're watching a complete guide to master serum,

[07:13] making sick ass sounds that people want to hear, keyword want to hear.

[07:18] OK, so. Usually what I'll do, for instance, this is I'll duplicate

[07:23] and you can use the system of serum to to just, you know, write it in like so.

[07:27] Boom. OK, boom.

[07:29] But I hate the system personally.

[07:31] So what I do is I'll record myself in Ableton like this.

[07:38] Boom.

[07:42] Right, we're going to fix that little mistake there.

[07:46] And then.

[07:48] After I've recorded myself, I'll just hit record here and play it out.

[07:56] OK, so that's OK, it's a little messed up,

[07:58] so I'm going to command a command Q, which is going to sync it up.

[08:06] OK, obviously I can fix it, but you get the point there.

[08:10] Command C we can undo if we right click.

[08:11] Also, there's all these new opportunities

[08:13] we can conform to a skill which we'll get into in a sec.

[08:15] Command L was that we can quantize with command Q.

[08:17] We can reverse with command R and we can scale time by 50 to 200 percent,

[08:22] which just means that we can slow it down or increase it.

[08:26] Like so. OK, the other cool thing is here when we record,

[08:29] if I record with this overdub feature, record these changes.

[08:41] And you're going to see the macros changing out there.

[08:43] OK, the extent just makes it so that when you reach the end, it continues further.

[08:48] We have the metronome button here as well.

[08:50] OK, from there we can zoom in and zoom out like like, you know, standard.

[08:54] We can also right click here.

[08:55] And again, like I said, increase, decrease.

[08:57] And you're going to find all of your little, you know, automations down here.

[09:02] So the way an ARP works, hopefully everyone knows already.

[09:05] If not, you play multiple notes and instead of the notes playing together,

[09:08] the ARP is going to play each note individually and it's going to do it

[09:11] in a way that you tell it to.

[09:12] For instance, we have the shape of the ARP, which is by default usually up.

[09:16] But we can go between a lot of them.

[09:17] And depending on the ARP that you use,

[09:20] it's going to give you different ones.

[09:21] All right. So a couple of things to note.

[09:23] You have your speed.

[09:25] OK, you have different subdivisions like triplets dotted,

[09:28] you're going to have heard so you can unsync.

[09:33] Another key thing to notice,

[09:34] these guys will be modulable from by envelopes and LFOs as well

[09:38] on certain parameters, which, again, crazy to think, right?

[09:41] Like now you can do that inside of a patch.

[09:43] So you can create some very intricate stuff from there.

[09:47] To the right of that, we're going to have the transposition section,

[09:50] which is one of my favorite, most underused sections.

[09:54] Essentially, we can shift the note.

[09:55] So by semitones, for instance, if I shift this one, that just means

[09:58] that when I play here and the range one.

[10:02] When I play a note or a number of notes,

[10:07] then after all notes are played that I've picked,

[10:10] this will get transposed up by a semitone and it will play there, too.

[10:12] So, for example, I'm going to be playing C, D sharp and G.

[10:15] Right now, if it lets me.

[10:21] And it's shifting up a semitone on the second turn around,

[10:24] and then it just keeps repeating.

[10:25] If I put two, it keeps doing that going up.

[10:33] So it's just shifting up every single repetition,

[10:36] and right now we have two because the range is set to two.

[10:38] Another way I like to use it is at 12.

[10:40] I can set that to 12 range two and then play it.

[10:46] And at very fast rates.

[10:51] And then up and down, let's do that.

[10:56] We create these sounds, which back then you probably heard going like,

[11:00] how the hell are they guys, these guys doing that?

[11:02] Because we're so used to hearing arps playing like this,

[11:05] right, which is why a lot of us don't use them.

[11:07] But, you know, people like Flume would use them in these crazy ways

[11:11] where it's just.

[11:16] Add a bit of release

[11:18] and you can see how that just sounds way more interesting, way more complex,

[11:23] way more like what the fuck is this making you feel a little insecure.

[11:25] Don't worry, it's not that tough.

[11:27] It's just knowing that, oh, you know, just moving the knob past something.

[11:31] So we can use the range for that, the speed 12.

[11:35] OK, to the right of that, we have a latch.

[11:37] Use the latch.

[11:38] You're going to play some like notes.

[11:40] You have the arp on and you want to let go.

[11:44] You can let go and it will just continue playing.

[11:46] OK, so that's the latch.

[11:48] From there, we have MIDI true, which I'm not too sure what it's for,

[11:51] but it looks like we can maybe through it.

[11:54] But I'll show you guys something else.

[11:55] I might have to deal with this MIDI out here, which we'll talk about in a sec.

[11:58] From there, we have the offset, offset of one.

[12:01] You can see instead of playing C like I should with the up,

[12:03] it's going to shift it to the right.

[12:04] So I'm going to start at D sharp instead.

[12:06] From there, we have the repeats, which I really like,

[12:08] especially because a lot of people don't like using arp because when you play it,

[12:13] it sounds like you're just repeating something constantly.

[12:15] But what if you could have it stop?

[12:16] Well, this is where this works, because now if you have chords.

[12:19] There we go.

[12:20] They're only repeats twice and then it stops.

[12:22] Now, if you start using these values here, you can get really cool melodies,

[12:26] randomize and stuff because now watch.

[12:35] And offset a bit, your gate controls the length of each note.

[12:40] And then the chance is the probability of the notes playing.

[12:43] So if you lower that, you introduce probability randomness

[12:46] into whether notes going to be playing or not to the right.

[12:50] We have we trigger for that, which is going to deal with when you play a new note.

[12:53] Is it going to re-trigger your rate and then your note first, etc.

[12:58] So velocity one is weird because it comes down.

[13:00] So, for example, right, I'm going to have my arp and I can target, let's say here.

[13:05] Boom. I'm going to set my velocity to this.

[13:08] So now the cutoff filter is going to be dependent on the velocity.

[13:13] I play higher up, it's going to stay up, but that's the thing.

[13:16] When I play up, if I have this velocity set, I'm playing at the highest value

[13:20] since there's a decay, it's working its way down to the targeted velocity.

[13:24] So if I'm hitting at 127 on this guy up here, it's going to work its way down.

[13:30] And you can see it works its way down to the targeted and it stays there.

[13:39] OK, and then.

[13:46] And then you're going to have a bank.

[13:47] But now I want to show you guys probably one of the most hidden sections

[13:53] that is insane in Serum 2, and I think it's worth its money.

[13:57] It was free after all.

[13:58] So if we go here, we can go into pattern mode and in pattern mode,

[14:02] I'm going to set the rate, which is the speed of the pattern to 1x.

[14:06] But if I click here now, this opens up, which is insane

[14:09] because now what we're doing is when we're playing an arp,

[14:11] usually it's we're playing more than one note.

[14:12] Usually it's chords, right?

[14:14] So how many notes are in a chord?

[14:16] Why we can say three to five notes, right?

[14:18] So the number you see here is going to pertain to the notes that you have.

[14:23] So if I play, let's say C, D sharp and G.

[14:26] Then zero is C.

[14:28] And I'll tell you, you can see the D sharp is a two note

[14:31] and then the two is the next one, which is the G.

[14:36] So now the cool thing about this for me is you can create a custom arp

[14:39] so it doesn't sound that repetitive.

[14:42] And now you can get crazy with it because you don't even know

[14:44] what notes you're going to play, you just play random notes.

[14:47] So then you have something like this, let's say.

[14:50] I'm going to play like something dark.

[14:58] Again, and they change

[15:00] depending on the notes that I'm collecting.

[15:04] So right now I'm holding down like a lot.

[15:07] So the cool thing is now below that we have these accents, which gives us access

[15:10] to essentially like acid style patterns that we can create.

[15:15] So the action, what it's going to do, it's going to make the velocity

[15:17] and we're going to turn this off as they make the velocity jump.

[15:20] So right now I'm going to play low.

[15:22] So velocity should start down here.

[15:23] When it accents, it's going to jump up.

[15:28] So it's going to happen now with accents, right?

[15:31] I can program the velocity to certain things that will make it jump.

[15:38] So I'm playing that pattern.

[15:41] I can also play chords if I wanted to.

[15:44] And then the settings are going to be very similar.

[15:46] The rap is just going to be determining how notes, when you have more than

[15:51] the intended that you have, how many notes, how is it going to pertain

[15:55] to that when it's below or above it?

[15:57] So.

[15:59] So I'm going to play.

[16:04] OK, so I'm going to hold this and latch it.

[16:08] So now it's just going to keep going.

[16:11] It also offset this.

[16:14] So now the notes change.

[16:16] They should land.

[16:18] Slow it down.

[16:23] I'm going to increase the speed now.

[16:29] At the velocity to other stuff like decay.

[16:37] Same thing here.

[16:45] The gate.

[16:55] Chord mode again.

[16:57] I like it for that.

[17:13] Now, if you're wondering what's happening, that's where this bottom

[17:16] right midi out comes into play because I can turn it on now.

[17:19] If I set clip player on, it's only going to play the stuff from the clip and

[17:22] it won't incorporate the ARP into it.

[17:23] But if I set it on, it's going to incorporate the ARP.

[17:26] So I'm going to do command shift T to open up a new channel.

[17:28] I'm going to select here and I'm going to go to Serum 2.

[17:32] I'm going to go click here, Serum 2.

[17:33] I'm going to click in and record this.

[17:35] So if you want.

[17:41] So you can see that I can play the three notes, which I'm playing just

[17:45] the standard chord here, which is the C, D sharp G, but then it gets transposed up.

[17:51] So pretty much grabbing that C up to the G like this.

[17:54] And it looks like now the G is at the bottom and then you have this at the top.

[17:58] So it looks like the G is going up and it's inverting the

[18:02] chord, which is very interesting.

[18:04] So we can use that to kind of see what is happening with this.

[18:08] Finally, at the bottom, we're going to have the keyboard option, which is going

[18:12] to allow us to pretty much limit our keyboard.

[18:14] So here we have a MIDI keyboard that I'm playing the standard.

[18:17] However, if I set this to, let's say D minor, this is going to shift all the

[18:21] notes that I'm playing that aren't part of that scale into the scale.

[18:24] So for example, I'm going to be playing here this D sharp and I can't play it

[18:30] because it's not part of the D minor scale.

[18:32] And then we can also use swing on this to add swing to some of the ARPs.

[18:36] Like for instance.

[18:40] And to the clip as well.

[18:42] So if you have something in the clip, you can add swing that way.

[18:45] Notice that as I switch the key, you can also see the octave

[18:49] intervals for that key and the clip.

[18:53] You can transpose.

[18:54] For example, if I play an F and I transpose up by one or two, it's going

[18:58] to put me up at the next note, up a semitone and then from there we have this.

[19:03] But the interesting thing to me is this oscillator mapping.

[19:06] The way you would use this is let's say that, you know, you kind of know what

[19:10] kind of music you want to make, or you want to create a patch that someone

[19:13] with a long keyboard can use, or they can create essentially a bass and a

[19:17] lead at the same time, giving them like two options, then you can do that.

[19:21] For example, I'm going to make a re-space here.

[19:26] And I'm going to filter it.

[19:28] Okay.

[19:28] Now oscillator A is this guy.

[19:31] So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make it so that I can only play

[19:33] this between C0 to C2, but if I play above that, nothing happens.

[19:43] So oscillator B, I'm going to make it so that it plays above that.

[19:49] Okay.

[19:50] So now the cool thing about that is I can have something like

[19:53] a re-space playing down here.

[19:58] And I can create a sound on top here, like a nice little pluck or like a

[20:03] super solid kind of pluck sound that's going to play there, and I'm going to

[20:10] make it so this one goes to just filter two, and I'm going to route it like this.

[20:17] I'm going to set some release to it.

[20:26] So then from there, I can do stuff like play, not play a full out track, so.

[20:46] The other thing too, is let's say I decide to FM from this guy over here.

[20:53] You're not going to hear it do anything because this guy's not playing at all

[20:57] until it hits the top one, right?

[20:59] So if you set warp on, it will make it so that no matter if it's playing or not,

[21:04] you're still applying the FM, the warp from any of the ones where you need,

[21:09] essentially, where you need a modulator, right?

[21:11] So which would be that one.

[21:12] So that's how that one works there.

[21:16] Okay.

[21:16] So these are all the settings and clip and ARP.

[21:20] Last thing to note is that if you just want to kind of make something for

[21:24] yourself on how something should be played, maybe you make a cool little

[21:27] sound like this one, and you just want to know how it's being played.

[21:30] All you have to do is right click on this guy and set as preview clip.

[21:33] So now when you go here and you click on this little play button, it's going to

[21:41] show you the example of how or what you recorded in there.

[21:50] Okay.

[21:51] So have fun with it, guys.
