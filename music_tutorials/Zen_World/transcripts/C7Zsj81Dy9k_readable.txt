[00:00] New year, new sound.

[00:12] Maybe you get more emotion.

[00:18] I really don't know what they're putting the water in the UK, but I like what's coming

[00:22] out of there, man.

[00:23] But we still got to pay homage to the classics, right?

[00:28] Deep Dish, oh my God.

[00:38] I'll have analog since, and lately I've been putting them to use to create baselines like

[00:42] this one for you guys.

[00:43] With AI coming and with all the countless Serum 2 presets out there, I always ask myself,

[00:47] how can I provide something to you guys that's different, at least provides a different flavor?

[00:51] It's not that analog is better than digital.

[00:52] It's all about providing that option.

[00:54] FM style baselines are also coming in.

[01:06] So if you've been seeking a different style of bassline for your tech house or minimal

[01:10] house tracks, I got you.

[01:11] Here's one by Riordan that I really like.

[01:20] The key thing for me is, yes, we can sample a lot of these baselines because it's John

[01:24] is very sampled.

[01:25] But for me, it's like paying homage, right?

[01:27] You learn from the past that you don't peek in the past.

[01:30] You don't peek in high school.

[01:31] You use that to kind of move forward and innovate on what they've done.

[01:34] Learning the process of it allows me to provide different flavors that are similar to it,

[01:38] but can be a little bit more unique.

[01:47] Some people like Dior, but I like Prada.

[01:55] Let's get spicy with this one.

[02:13] This is one of the ones that sampled from some of the stuff over there to give you,

[02:16] again, access to a different tone.

[02:17] It's the same proven to work sound that Josh Baker uses, but now it has its own flavor

[02:22] because if people ask, yo, man, it sounds kind of like Josh Baker.

[02:24] You go, yeah, you know, but I kind of reworked it a bit and made it my own, man.

[02:38] Now Minimal Nights Volume 3 is going to contain basslines, chords, stabs, leads, plucks, all

[02:42] in the style of the UK guys.

[03:02] Some genres also for the breaks, they have these kind of sounds.

[03:09] I really want one of you guys to use this sound, especially the Dusty Shop, it's a substance

[03:21] that makes you feel good.

[03:32] This part, one of my favorite sounds, with Serum 2 being out for a while, I really wanted

[03:36] to capture the granular sound of it, but in a cool way that can add to the song rather

[03:41] than just go, oh, cool, granular, and that's it.

[03:43] So this is a good example.

[03:44] For example, we're going to bring this mod up, which activates this.

[03:52] Oh, fuck.

[04:00] Relax your...

[04:23] It's getting housey, bro.

[05:00] And I had to add this one.

[05:13] The good thing is there was a bunch of guys online debating about how that sound is made,

[05:18] which gave me the tools needed to recreate it.

[05:20] So that was fun.

[05:33] Back, back, back to the beat.

[05:38] Very spacey sounds.

[05:40] Very nasty bass lines that are a little bit more defined.

[05:42] Because in my mind, when I make these sounds, my hope is that you grab them and you infuse

[05:46] it with what you already do best.

[05:48] Maybe the sounds can work in a break.

[05:49] You can infuse it with your drop elements that you usually go for.

[05:53] At the end of the day, that's the beauty of music is that you can mix and match different

[05:56] sounds, different genres to create new things that are still familiar, but fresh to your

[06:01] listeners.

[06:01] I like this one a lot.

[06:02] The Dean Brothers, man.

[06:03] I'm no hater, man.

[06:05] But god damn, they're fucking good.

[06:06] You can't get me out of your mind.

[06:11] Oh no, you got me going insane.

[06:16] A really nice acid bass sound.

[06:28] Now Chris Duzzi has been on a little bit of a hiatus, but it's all good.

[06:31] I'm pretty sure he's making bangers.

[06:45] Oh, I love that cocaine knob.

[06:56] Now, this particular patch is inspired by the Roland style JB 1080 synths, where it's

[07:01] a combination of an organic sound with a spectral wavetable sound as a layer, which sounds like

[07:06] this.

[07:15] You can see what it adds.

[07:17] It adds a nice mystical flow to the sound, and that's the power of it.

[07:20] I wanted to remake this one because this sound, this track went viral on TikTok, which I believe

[07:27] it's inspired by one of Donna Summer's tracks, which was produced by Giorgio Moroder.

[07:31] But it's a really cool sound with just a nice 80s flavor to it.

[07:34] The cool thing about presets, right, is if you use the sound, it's kind of like, okay,

[07:36] it sounds exactly like Jam Back.

[07:39] However, having the programming, what you can do is start to switch maybe some other

[07:43] way to change the tone of the sound.

[07:49] Or use the sound as a starting point, because presets, while yeah, you can use them as they

[07:52] are, a lot of the times they're really good starting points that you can take further

[07:56] in order to create something that feels more yours.

[07:59] If you guys already know this sound, well, I made it using Serum 2, and now you guys

[08:04] can learn from it and see how I programmed it in order to get it to sound that way.

[08:28] I've been working on this pack for a while, guys, and it's finally done and you guys can

[08:31] check it out at evilsounds.com.

[08:33] It's going to be a total of 100 and Serum 2 presets, all in the style of Chris Stussie,

[08:38] Josh Baker, Max Dean, Luke Dean, MK.

[08:42] It took a lot of inspiration from them to make sounds that I know will work for your

[08:45] music.

[08:46] Proven to work sounds from proven to work track.

[08:48] My goal is all about making music writing for you have less friction so that when you

[08:52] have the time to make music, you create a lot more bomb ideas because you have bomb

[08:56] sounds to get inspired.

[08:57] By the time you watch this video, it's already the new year, so I hope that you guys enjoyed

[09:00] it with loved ones.

[09:01] And I want to thank you guys for the support these past 10 years.

[09:04] So with that being said, use me, guys.

[09:06] Use me in any way or form you want.

[09:07] See you guys for another one.

[09:09] Take care and you guys have a great rest of your day.
