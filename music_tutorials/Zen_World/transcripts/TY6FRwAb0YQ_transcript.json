    "text": "Hey, what's up, ninjas? Today we are going into the sections that I'm not going to lie, puzzle me a little bit. I was like, why do we need a clip mode inside of Serum 2? Why do we need an ARP inside of Serum? Well, that one we definitely need it. But the clip and then the oscillator mapping was also a bit of an iffy for me. But today I will demystify it all for you because this is a complete guide to Master Serum. Clip mode for me is an opportunity to show everyone that uses my sounds how the sounds are intended to be used. For example, here we have one called the Busta, which is going to have this clip set. OK, now, a couple of things to note here with your clip mode, you can access the clip section bottom left here by right clicking. You can lock it in case you wanted to lock it, but also MIDI input trigger octave. Essentially, what these things are doing here, the ARP and the clip and why there's a keyboard down there is because after a certain octave range, let's say C Syrup, everything you play down there starts to sound theoretically kind of like too low for any comprehension of tonality. You know, stuff down there won't have melody, etc. So, you know, programs like Kontakt, Native Instruments use the bottom section to switch between different playing modes of different, you know, let's say string libraries they might have. So in Serum 2, however, those bottom ones like C negative 2 is going to switch between the different clips you have and between the different ARPs you have. The next thing is you're going to have access here to some banks so you can create banks for yourself. You can save clip banks, which is going to save all of this. You're also going to have here like some factory banks like the Duda Chords, Neo Chords, for instance, here that you can go. Now you can switch between and if you can tell there's something that right now that's making it just stay there, it's not moving from the left to the right, and we'll talk about that in a sec. But in essence, that's where you're going to find the bank here. All the different clips you can have and you can make some for yourself, for instance, one of the things you can put in here if you wanted to is like rolling bass patterns or or patterns for house music, patterns for trance and so forth. OK, you're going to have trigger mode here, which is mono or poly. This is going to pertain to essentially your your clips. Can you play more than one clip at the same time? So I'm going to lower down the volume just a tiny bit here. And play. You can see it's just kind of like switching between all of them. But if I said poly. And they can all play at the same time and maybe there's some magic there. Maybe there's not. So we have the clips there. So that's what this is for. And it all is going to make it so that we can edit all of the clips that are found here with these settings down here that we're going to be going through. OK, now below that, we have clip settings now, individual clip, right, each clip individual. So the bank is the overall and then you have clips inside of it. And as you go between them, you can see here that you can change certain things about them. OK, and edit all can alter that. From there, you have the length, which is how long your intended clip is going to be. To the bottom of that, we have the keyboard span, which is just going to pertain to essentially. If I played, let's see a clip. I can pretty much transpose the clip. I get on the keyboard. God damn, my ears are bleeding, man. Hopefully you guys are OK. Essentially, I can transpose it. So I have two options for that. And then I can also offset it, offset it. Each note that I play is going to make it start at a different section. So the way I see that is it's a cool way to kind of play a clip, you know, like randomizing. A lot of people don't usually make music and it always sounds the same. So some people will record themselves playing and then randomize the way it plays or they will reverse it so that they get something different that they wouldn't have thought of. They record for progressions and then randomize it to get different progressions out of the progression, because, again, we fall into habits. And these are all ways and strategies of breaking the habits. OK, from here, we can transpose it by one or two. And you're going to notice this number is changing because I have it all. You can see they're all changing. But if I just lower that down, you can see that now only the individual one is changing. So if I said edit all and I reset the controls, hopefully they all change with that boom, like so. OK. From there, below that, we have what I would call one of the more unique things about this system that Serum 2 provides, which is the way that it's playing. So, for example, here, we're going to play this real quick. OK, so normal mode, normal, we can reverse it. We can pendulum it, which means that it's going to hit the end and then it's going to reverse into itself. We can also increase the rate, which I'm going to do just to kind of go through these multiple quick. There you go, that's pendulum. We have random, which is going to just jump all over the place. We have random, no duplication. OK, so obviously it's not going to duplicate unless after it's played all of them, we have random start. Let's play it from the beginning. Random ending and let's move this here a little to the right. And then we have the one shot, which will just play the whole thing, and then we have static, which is going to make it so that you only play the first note combination. So if I play, let's say this, it's only going to play the beginning of it. And this is useful because if you go back to the chord section here where Steve Duda provided all these chords, they're all set to static. And the idea of them, again, is going to be. Again, you just get to go between the chords, so it makes it useful because that way the clip isn't moving to the right and then you lose the chord. And then from here, if you remember, if we select the keyboard, span them on and play. Yeah, you can play, you can transpose the chord up or down, but. Each one's going to have time signatures here, which is going to be just the beats, one fourth, one eighth, how you divide everything up by below that, we have the speed, which is the rate. So we can go twice as fast and we can also go into the subdivisions of triplet and of dotted as well. And then we have the quantization on the launch, which is going to have to deal with how it syncs up. Then we have the returns, Velo return and return, which is going to mean every time we switch a note. How is this clip going to react the way that I personally use the clips? A lot of the times for me, it's going to come down to making the sound and then giving an example of how I intend the sound to be used. For example, there was this track that MK did that got a shit ton of streams with the sound. What you guys should know how to do by now, because you're watching a complete guide to master serum, making sick ass sounds that people want to hear, keyword want to hear. OK, so. Usually what I'll do, for instance, this is I'll duplicate and you can use the system of serum to to just, you know, write it in like so. Boom. OK, boom. But I hate the system personally. So what I do is I'll record myself in Ableton like this. Boom. Right, we're going to fix that little mistake there. And then. After I've recorded myself, I'll just hit record here and play it out. OK, so that's OK, it's a little messed up, so I'm going to command a command Q, which is going to sync it up. OK, obviously I can fix it, but you get the point there. Command C we can undo if we right click. Also, there's all these new opportunities we can conform to a skill which we'll get into in a sec. Command L was that we can quantize with command Q. We can reverse with command R and we can scale time by 50 to 200 percent, which just means that we can slow it down or increase it. Like so. OK, the other cool thing is here when we record, if I record with this overdub feature, record these changes. And you're going to see the macros changing out there. OK, the extent just makes it so that when you reach the end, it continues further. We have the metronome button here as well. OK, from there we can zoom in and zoom out like like, you know, standard. We can also right click here. And again, like I said, increase, decrease. And you're going to find all of your little, you know, automations down here. So the way an ARP works, hopefully everyone knows already. If not, you play multiple notes and instead of the notes playing together, the ARP is going to play each note individually and it's going to do it in a way that you tell it to. For instance, we have the shape of the ARP, which is by default usually up. But we can go between a lot of them. And depending on the ARP that you use, it's going to give you different ones. All right. So a couple of things to note. You have your speed. OK, you have different subdivisions like triplets dotted, you're going to have heard so you can unsync. Another key thing to notice, these guys will be modulable from by envelopes and LFOs as well on certain parameters, which, again, crazy to think, right? Like now you can do that inside of a patch. So you can create some very intricate stuff from there. To the right of that, we're going to have the transposition section, which is one of my favorite, most underused sections. Essentially, we can shift the note. So by semitones, for instance, if I shift this one, that just means that when I play here and the range one. When I play a note or a number of notes, then after all notes are played that I've picked, this will get transposed up by a semitone and it will play there, too. So, for example, I'm going to be playing C, D sharp and G. Right now, if it lets me. And it's shifting up a semitone on the second turn around, and then it just keeps repeating. If I put two, it keeps doing that going up. So it's just shifting up every single repetition, and right now we have two because the range is set to two. Another way I like to use it is at 12. I can set that to 12 range two and then play it. And at very fast rates. And then up and down, let's do that. We create these sounds, which back then you probably heard going like, how the hell are these guys doing that? Because we're so used to hearing arps playing like this, right, which is why a lot of us don't use them. But, you know, people like Flume would use them in these crazy ways where it's just. Add a bit of release. And you can see how that just sounds way more interesting, way more complex, way more like what the fuck is this making you feel a little insecure. Don't worry, it's not that tough. It's just knowing that, oh, you know, just moving the knob past something. So we can use the range for that, the speed 12. OK, to the right of that, we have a latch. Use the latch. You're going to play some like notes. You have the arp on and you want to let go. You can let go and it will just continue playing. OK, so that's the latch. From there, we have MIDI true, which I'm not too sure what it's for, but it looks like we can maybe through it. But I'll show you guys something else. I might have to deal with this MIDI out here, which we'll talk about in a sec. From there, we have the offset, offset of one. You can see instead of playing C like I should with the up, it's going to shift it to the right. So I'm going to start at D sharp instead. From there, we have the repeats, which I really like, especially because a lot of people don't like using arp because when you play it, it sounds like you're just repeating something constantly. But what if you could have it stop? Well, this is where this works, because now if you have chords. There we go. They're only repeats twice and then it stops. Now, if you start using these values here, you can get really cool melodies, randomize and stuff because now watch. And offset a bit, your gate controls the length of each note. And then the chance is the probability of the notes playing. So if you lower that, you introduce probability randomness into whether notes going to be playing or not to the right. We have we trigger for that, which is going to deal with when you play a new note. Is it going to re-trigger your rate and then your note first, et cetera. So velocity one is weird because it comes down. So, for example, right. I'm going to have my arp and I can target, let's say here. Boom. I'm going to set my velocity to this. So now the cutoff filter is going to be dependent on the velocity. I play higher up, it's going to stay up, but that's the thing. When I play up, if I have this velocity set, I'm playing at the highest value since there's a decay, it's working its way down to the targeted velocity. So if I'm hitting at one twenty seven on this guy up here, it's going to work its way down. And you can see it works its way down to the targeted and it stays there. And. And you're going to have a bank, but now I want to show you guys probably one of the most hidden sections that is insane in Serum 2 and I think it's worth its money. It was free after all. So if we go here, we can go into pattern mode and in pattern mode, I'm going to set the rate, which is the speed of the pattern to one X. But if I click here now, this opens up, which is insane because now what we're doing is when we're playing an arp, usually it's we're playing more than one note. Usually it's chords. Right. So how many notes are in a chord? Why we can say three to five notes. Right. So the number you see here is going to pertain to the notes that you have. So if I play, let's say C, D sharp and G. Then zero is C. And I'll tell you, you can see the D sharp is a two note and then the two is the next one, which is the G. So now the cool thing about this for me is you can create a custom arp so it doesn't sound that repetitive. And now you can get crazy with it because you don't even know what notes you're going to play. You just play random notes. So then you have something like this, let's say. I'm going to play like something dark. Again, and they change and on the notes that I'm selecting. So right now I'm holding down like a lot. So the cool thing is now below that we have these accents, which gives us access to essentially like acid style patterns that we can create. So the action, what it's going to do, it's going to make the velocity and we're going to turn this off. They make the velocity jump. So right now I'm going to play low. So velocity should start down here. When it accents, it's going to jump up. So it's going to happen now with the accents, right? I can program the velocity to certain things that will make it jump. So I'm playing that pattern. I can also play chords if I wanted to. And then the settings are going to be very similar. The rap is just going to be determining how notes, when you have more than the intended that you have, how many notes, how is it going to pertain to that when it's below or above it?  So I'm going to play. OK, so I'm going to hold this and latch it. So now it's just going to keep going. You can also offset this. So now the notes change. They should land and slow it down. I'm going to increase the speed now. And the velocity to other stuff like decay. Same thing here. The gate. Chord mode again. I like it for that. Now, if you're wondering what's happening, that's where this bottom right MIDI out comes into play because I can turn it on. Now, if I set clip player on, it's only going to play the stuff from the clip and it won't incorporate the ARP into it. But if I set it on, it's going to incorporate the ARP. So I'm going to do command shift T to open up a new channel. I'm going to select here and I'm going to go to Serum 2. I'm going to go click here, Serum 2. I'm going to click in and record this. So if you want. So you can see that I can play the three notes, which I'm playing just the standard chord here, which is the C, D sharp, G. But then it gets transposed up. So pretty much grabbing that C up to the G like this. And it looks like now the G is at the bottom and then you have this at the top. So it looks like the G is going up and it's inverting the chord, which is very interesting. So we can use that to kind of see what is happening with this. Finally, at the bottom, we're going to have the keyboard option, which is going to allow us to pretty much limit our keyboard. So here we have a MIDI keyboard that I'm playing the standard. However, if I set this to, let's say, D minor, this is going to shift all the notes that I'm playing that aren't part of that scale into the scale. So, for example, I'm going to be playing here this D sharp and I can't play it because it's not part of the D minor scale. And then we can also use swing on this to add swing to some of the ARPs. Like for instance. And to the clip as well. So if you have something in the clip, you can add swing that way. Notice that as I switch the key, you can also see the octave intervals for that key and the clip. You can transpose, for example, if I play an F and I transpose up by one or two, it's going to put me up at the next note, up a semitone. And then from there we have this. But the interesting thing to me is this oscillator mapping. The way you would use this is, let's say that, you know, you kind of know what kind of music you want to make or you want to create a patch that someone with a long keyboard can use or they can create essentially a bass and a lead at the same time, giving them like two options, then you can do that. For example, I'm going to make a re-space here. And I'm going to filter it. OK, now oscillator A is this guy. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make it so that I can only play this between C0 to C2. But if I play above that, nothing happens. So oscillator B, I'm going to make it so that it plays above that. OK, so now the cool thing about that is I can have something like a re-space playing down here. And I can create a sound on top here, like a nice little pluck or like a super solid kind of pluck sound that's going to play there. And I'm going to make it so this one goes to just filter 2. And I'm going to route it like this. I'm going to set some release to it. So then from there. I can do stuff like play, not play a full track, so. The other thing too is let's say I decide to FM from this guy over here. You're not going to hear it do anything because this guy is not playing at all until it hits the top one, right? So if you set warp on, it will make it so that no matter if it's playing or not, you're still applying the FM, the warp from any of the ones where you need essentially where you need a modulator, right? So which would be that one. So that's how that one works there. OK, so these are all the settings and clip and arp. Last thing to note is that if you just want to kind of make something for yourself on how something should be played, maybe you make a cool little sound like this one and you just want to know how it's being played. All you have to do is right click on this guy and set as preview clip. So now when you go here and you click on this little play button. It's going to show you the example of how or what you recorded in there. OK, so have fun with it, guys, as I told you guys, the arp section is insane. It's one of the hidden gems no one's really talking about. So we'll see what's up with that. But other than that, you guys take care and just have a great rest of your day.",
