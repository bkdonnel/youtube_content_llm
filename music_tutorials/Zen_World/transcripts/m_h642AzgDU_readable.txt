================================================================================

[00:10] I'm gonna teach you guys how to shake that butt like Riordan.

[00:18] Now a lot of the times I'm building my grooves out with the 909 core kit.

[00:21] It takes the choice out of everything because a lot of people get stuck picking the samples.

[00:25] It's very important to work on the rhythm, the midi first.

[00:27] So let's get this thing started.

[00:28] So here we have an 8 bar loop and all I'm going to do is put the open hat on the off.

[00:34] So I'm going to go into the 909 open hat and lower it.

[00:43] From there the clap on the 2 and the 4.

[00:47] Now here's where we're going to swag it up.

[00:49] We're going to right click and now we're going to go into six scenes.

[00:51] Now these new two sections here is where the swing of a track in most house tracks is going

[00:57] to come from.

[00:57] So in theory if you wanted something set in stone that you can always do.

[01:01] It's not wrong to say that if you're making a track like this you can always have a snare

[01:04] drum hit.

[01:05] When the clap hits 3 squares to the right in 16th grid.

[01:11] Now I'm going to switch this because that sounds like someone's getting their ass beat.

[01:17] I can use these features here to design the drum.

[01:19] Usually I like to lower down the tone to make it a lot more tight.

[01:28] Now from there I can choose to do another one but I'm going to follow the man reordering

[01:35] himself.

[01:35] I'm going to do another one here but this time I'm not going to double.

[01:41] I can duplicate this and here I'm going to do a triple hit.

[01:59] Now with these ones there's something very important that you must do and that is control

[02:03] the velocity.

[02:03] The velocity is a parameter which is going to be able to know how hard the note is being

[02:08] hit or how loud you want the snare to be played at the exact moment that we're altering the

[02:12] 

[02:12] So what I can do is on some parts lower the velocity like so.

[02:19] It's going to make it like hit like loud.

[02:21] But the thing that I've noticed with people is that when you play something a lot quieter

[02:26] the tonality kind of feels like it's changing.

[02:30] But in theory it's not.

[02:31] It's just the volume is going down.

[02:33] What makes people hear that and go is there pitch automation going on which sometimes

[02:36] there might be however just going down the volume you can add a lot of like that feeling

[02:40] of groove.

[02:41] It's not robotic because everything's hitting at the same velocity the same volume.

[02:52] And I'm just going to duplicate this across like so.

[02:56] And yeah you can add more variation more micro variations if you want but with this you're

[03:01] going to be pretty much better than most.

[03:02] Now this whole time I thought I didn't have swing but I do have swing which you can find

[03:06] here.

[03:07] Now this is what's really going to make the space of loop that you've created just feel

[03:10] a lot more alive.

[03:12] And what this is going to do is it's going to grab these notes and it's going to shift

[03:16] them to the right slightly.

[03:17] Now by how much is dependent on the groove the swing you decide to apply.

[03:22] So if we click here on the bring up your collection of grooves so I'm going to have different

[03:25] ones than you.

[03:26] Everyone's going to have all different kinds you know variety.

[03:30] There we go but the one I've decided to pick is the Ableton one which is the swing 1664.

[03:36] 64 is the intensity of the swing and the 16 means that it's going to be applied to the

[03:40] notes that are hitting on those 16's those pockets we were talking about.

[03:43] Notice that when I have the timing up you want to bob the head but when I have it down

[03:53] it sounds bleached.

[03:56] We need to unbleach that.

[04:06] I added a tambourine which is also going to get the swing.

[04:14] If you were going to be applying swing to a loop you command A the loop by clicking

[04:18] here and then you command U or quantize and you can also go into Ableton's transform section

[04:24] here and quantize it here as you can see there there's a quantize feature and then

[04:28] from there you would quantize to 16.

[04:32] Now from there what Ableton's going to do since you're telling it that you want the

[04:35] swing 16 on it which you're going to be able to see here.

[04:38] From there it's going to apply the same swing we've added to this snare here.

[04:42] So if I were to commit it by just clicking this arrow you're going to see that some notes

[04:46] are getting shifted to the right while other ones remain and that is what's going to give

[04:49] you that swag.

[04:55] But what if you wanted to program your own tambourine and you don't want to use mine's

[04:59] for some reason.

[05:00] Just get yourself a nice tambourine sample set at 16 like so.

[05:05] Now I'm going to loop it so that I can drag it out so it's already looped I'm just going

[05:08] to drag it all the way because the sample's not really going to change so that's where

[05:11] we loop it.

[05:14] Now from here you can choose to move some of the notes or play with the velocities.

[05:25] You can also get a more natural sounding one.

[05:38] I'm going to show you guys a super clutch trick that's super easy to implement.

[05:41] One thing you can do is you can grab this guy and from there command E and turn it into

[05:48] 2.

[05:49] So now you get this double hit there which is going to add even more swag.

[06:04] And since you have this swing applied this open hat gets that swing the last one and

[06:09] that makes a tasty ass boom.

[06:12] What magic.

[06:12] Right.

[06:13] And then you can play with the velocity too if you choose.

[06:22] I do have a reverse clap here.

[06:25] It's been making itself known.

[06:27] I'm just going to lower the volume.

[06:30] The purpose of it is to lead you into that last clap which creates a very nice swag and

[06:35] another variation to it of course is to do it every 2 bars if you choose to.

[06:49] From there I recommend grabbing loops and chopping up the parts that you like.

[06:53] For example.

[06:57] There's a very heavy loop that has a lot going on.

[07:01] However, I don't really want all of that so what I can do is start to chop to get what

[07:08] I like.

[07:10] Cue it to just grab that rim that I really like the pattern.

[07:30] It's a very dusty loop.

[07:32] Now the reason that I'm adding loops like this is because I'm trying to fill in the

[07:37] gaps with other style of drums to add flavor but at the same time sometimes we might want

[07:41] more we just don't know and that's where sample packs will come into play.

[07:45] You should use them as sort of inspiration where you could maybe get inspired and do

[07:49] your own pattern to it or maybe you like the tone and texture that the sample provides.

[07:54] Back then I was super super strict on not using top loops like this over existing drums

[07:58] because there's always the fear or the risk of cancelling out phasing out which is where

[08:03] two drums that sound the same hit and it sounds rather odd.

[08:06] However, after being in some sessions with some more veteran producers that make some

[08:10] bomb music I've noticed a lot of them don't really care about it and when I asked the

[08:13] way it was explained to me is that a lot of the times these drums will add a noise floor

[08:17] and what that means is without those drums there's like an empty gap in the song that

[08:22] isn't being filled and the way they see it it adds texture.

[08:25] The key thing of course is being aware that this can lead to some detrimental

[08:29] issues that will arise with the audio where you're going to find like the audio just

[08:33] sounds a lot shittier but the question is is it on purpose and does it add to the character

[08:37] of the song and that's really up to you to decide what your taste as a producer.

[08:42] From there I can now start to replace some of the drums in the core kit.

[08:50] Now let's compare.

[08:57] Not bad.

[09:00] And this one just has a lot more character on the snare drum it doesn't sound so stocked

[09:03] but it doesn't mean the other snare is bad the other snare has a bit more weight so that

[09:07] actually tells me something as I compare both and it opens up to my eyes that I maybe need

[09:10] a little more body on this.

[09:32] And of course I'm making it a case to use the 909 kick drum from Ableton it's just

[09:36] it's like a like a test to yourself when you get that thing to sound good

[09:39] then you know you're a real producer.

[09:44] That's going to be essentially saturated to give it a bit more meat this is going to make the

[09:49] kick more of a blob but that's what we want from there I'm using this Neutron Ford Transient

[09:54] Shaper for the only fact that it's a multi-band so essentially it lets me split up the kick

[09:58] into different frequency sides and then from there this I can get rid of that nasty noise

[10:06] that whoever at Ableton recorded it like you can see okay there we can kind of just make it a

[10:11] little clean from there I'm shortening it a bit with kickstart which is essentially just volume

[10:15] automation the way you see it the volume is allowed here at full and then it slowly gets reduced.

[10:21] But from here I'm using standard clip just to clip off just the tip the key thing though

[10:26] is I don't want to clip the low end because anytime you clip low and it's going to sound

[10:29] so I'm going to ease off and there we go.

[10:37] That's just controlling that peak because that peak is going to trigger the compressor so this

[10:40] is just a couple of things that I've done in order to make this be a lot more friendlier

[10:43] to compressors and the limiter on the master. Now let's talk about the processing of the drums

[10:48] because this is where I had one of probably the biggest revelations that I've had when it comes

[10:52] to these type of drums and that is the usage little thing called an AK-9X which is a preamp that is

[10:57] created to mimic the color of an old school Akai sampler. Let me show you when I turn all this off how it sounds.

[11:06] Yeah so these drums need a bit of love let me show you what's really going to give these drums

[11:10] flavor this is the stuff they don't show you because they just don't want you to have the

[11:14] flavor they're scared of your ideas because they know you are going to kill it more than they are.

[11:18] Let's not blow someone else's candle to light ours unless they ain't gonna show us the goods.

[11:22] The first thing is some compression this is something that you can write down for yourself

[11:25] that you can always have and that is going to be a compressor the glue from Ableton

[11:29] that is going to be set to a two to one ratio two for every two db that goes over the threshold

[11:34] being hit when the needle moves one db will come out so it's not going to be that hard.

[11:37] The next thing is the attack can either be 30 or 10 it just really depends on how tight you want

[11:42] your drums to feel 10 is going to allow for more gain reduction and it's going to grab onto the

[11:46] drum a lot quicker meaning that it's going to be a lot shorter on the compression 30 you're

[11:51] again it's going to be very minuscule because we're talking about 10 milliseconds 30 milliseconds

[11:57] here so i'm going to go with the 10 release we want it fast because if we leave it

[12:02] that needle takes forever to go down and with drums they're fast hitting right so we want this

[12:07] compressor to grab on and do its thing when needed. Now the way this thing glues is by controlling

[12:11] the volume if something goes above the threshold meaning the clap hits a little louder than

[12:15] everything else because it's activating the threshold and nothing else is then it's going

[12:19] reduce the volume at that instant when the clap hits or 10 milliseconds after it triggers it

[12:24] meaning the volume gets reduced on the clap making it feel a lot more glued because the volume isn't

[12:29] like there's not a lot of change in volume inside the drum. Tape saturation is one of those things

[12:33] that's very beautiful essentially mimicking the idea of recording something to tape and as

[12:38] something was recorded to tape there was some saturation that occurred probably during like

[12:42] someone running hot on it and this one i like to use the drum bus preset and then from there i'll

[12:46] play with the input and the output so for example i'm going to lower these down right now so we don't bust

[13:01] that is how like it sounds louder yet it's quieter. Remember the ips is the color how fast

[13:06] this is moving but the lower the number the more rounded your high end is going to get so lower

[13:14] good for lo-fi i would say 15 is a good medium of like i'm kind of hippie and old school but i'm kind

[13:19] of not and 30 let's let's it all out the high end is just gonna be

[13:32] but i'm gonna go with 15 because it gives us more of that 90s flavor that roundness to to the high end

[13:49] now as i do this you're going to notice the claps the drums start to sound more flat if you want a

[13:53] good range for clipping i would say no more than 2 to 4 db of clipping occurring this is coming

[13:57] from a mentor i have that masters music for a living i did ask the question because i noticed

[14:01] a lot of people clip and i'll get into some sessions with some people that clip to god's end

[14:04] you can definitely clip and be all complex about it but at the end of the day composure is needed

[14:09] in music you do so much and you can push stuff to the limit for sure if it isn't doing anything

[14:13] for your music then you know have the confidence to say this is good enough finally my new favorite

[14:18] plug-in for this kind of stuff is ak9x which is going to be something that mimics an akai preamp

[14:25] the idea of it is is that when we use that we can reduce the quality of the sound the sample

[14:30] for the sake of rounding out the high end

[14:39] so

[14:41] what i want you to pay attention to is this section here i'm going to turn it on and off

[14:44] and you'll see what it's doing

[14:51] don't get out of

[15:03] now when we do that you notice there's a change to the way it sounds right

[15:07] and that is the missing key for me personally as i was trying to get

[15:11] a similar vibe to his drums again i'm not reordering so i'm not going to sound exactly like

[15:15] him he can be the best version of himself but i can still allow myself to learn from it and this

[15:19] is one of the things i learned that in order to sound the 90s vibe i need to think like in the

[15:24] 90s and this plug-in here allows me to put the color of this preamp that was in an akai sampler

[15:30] so a preamp is you can think about it like the input the output for instance on a microphone

[15:34] the preamp is meant to boost the gain of the microphone however certain preamps will have

[15:39] color to them a certain curve to them a certain tone that when you run that mic through it and

[15:44] you push the preamp past a certain point will provide that color that flavor to it and that's

[15:48] what we want with this

[16:00] all right you can hear the difference like that and i know a lot of you guys are going like oh

[16:03] what the if you guys want me to get into the bass let me know in the comments below i will break down

[16:07] the bass the patterns of the bass what you can learn from it to really put that into your production

[16:12] that being said if you guys want to support the channel and you like a lot of the sounds you heard

[16:14] in this little demo find them over at evilsounds.com minimal nights volume 3

[16:18] a pack that pays respect to the past but isn't defined by it
