================================================================================

[00:10] I'm gonna teach you guys how to shake that butt like Riordan.

[00:18] Now a lot of the times I'm building my grooves out with the 909 core kit.

[00:21] It takes the choice out of everything because a lot of people get stuck picking the samples.

[00:25] It's very important to work on the rhythm, the midi first.

[00:27] So let's get this thing started.

[00:28] So here we have an 8 bar loop and all I'm going to do is put the open hat on the off.

[00:34] So I'm going to go into the 909 open hat.

[00:37] And lower the...

[00:43] From there the clap on the 2 and the 4.

[00:47] Now here's where we're going to swag it up.

[00:49] We're going to right click and now we're going to go into 6 scenes.

[00:51] Now these new two sections here is where the swing of a track in most house tracks is going

[00:57] to come from.

[00:57] So in theory if you wanted something set in stone that you can always do.

[01:01] It's not wrong to say that if you're making a track like this you can always have a snare

[01:04] drum hit.

[01:05] When the clap hits 3 squares to the right in 16th grid.

[01:11] Now I'm going to switch this.

[01:13] Because that sounds like someone's getting their ass beat.

[01:17] I can use these features here to design the drum.

[01:19] Usually I like to lower down the tone to make it a lot more tight.

[01:28] Now from there I can choose to do another one.

[01:33] But I'm going to follow the man reordering himself.

[01:35] I'm going to do another one here.

[01:36] But this time I'm not going to double.

[01:41] I can duplicate this.

[01:49] And here I'm going to do a triple hit.

[01:59] Now with these ones there's something very important that you must do and that is control

[02:03] the velocity.

[02:04] The velocity is a parameter which is going to let able to know how hard the note is being

[02:08] hit or how loud you want the snare to be played at the exact moment that we're altering the

[02:12] velocity.

[02:12] So, what I can do is on some parts lower the velocity like so.

[02:19] It's going to make it hit like loud.

[02:21] But the thing that I've noticed with people is that when you play something a lot quieter

[02:26] the tonality kind of feels like it's changing.

[02:30] But in theory it's not.

[02:31] It's just the volume is going down.

[02:33] What makes people hear that and go is there pitch automation going on which sometimes

[02:36] there might be.

[02:37] However, just lowering down the volume can add a lot of that feeling of groove.

[02:41] If it's not robotic because everything's hitting at the same velocity, the same volume.

[02:52] And I'm just going to duplicate this across like so.

[02:57] And yeah, you can add more variation, more micro variations if you want but with this

[03:01] you're going to be pretty much better than most.

[03:02] Now this whole time I thought I didn't have swing but I do have swing which you can find

[03:06] here.

[03:07] Now this is what's really going to make the space of groove that you've created just feel

[03:10] a lot more alive.

[03:12] And what this is going to do is it's going to grab these notes and it's going to shift

[03:16] them to the right slightly.

[03:17] Now by how much is dependent on the groove, the swing you decide to apply.

[03:22] So if we click here on the go, bring up your collection of grooves, so I'm going to have

[03:25] different ones than you.

[03:26] Everyone's going to have all different kinds, you know, a variety.

[03:30] There we go.

[03:30] But the one I've decided to pick is the Ableton one which is the swing 1664.

[03:35] 64 is the intensity of the swing and the 16 means that it's going to be applied to the

[03:40] notes that are hitting on those 16's, those pockets we were talking about.

[03:43] Notice that when I have the timing up, you want to bob the head but when I have it down,

[03:53] it sounds bleached, we need to unbleach that.

[04:06] Right, I added a tambourine.

[04:13] Which is also going to get the swing.

[04:15] If you were going to be applying swing to a loop, you command A the loop by clicking

[04:18] here and then you command U or quantize.

[04:21] And you can also go into Ableton's transform section here and quantize it here as you can

[04:26] see there, there's a quantize feature.

[04:28] And then from there you would quantize to 16.

[04:32] Now, from there, what Ableton's going to do since you're telling it that you want the

[04:35] swing 16 on it, which you're going to be able to see here, from there it's going to apply

[04:38] the same swing we've added to this snare here.

[04:42] So if I were to commit it by just clicking this arrow, you're going to see that some

[04:46] notes are getting shifted to the right while other ones remain.

[04:48] And that is what's going to give you that swap.

[04:55] But what if you wanted to program your own tambourine and you don't want to use mines

[04:59] for some reason?

[05:00] Just get yourself a nice tambourine sample set at 16 like so.

[05:05] I'm going to loop it so that I can drag it out, so it's already looped, I'm just going

[05:08] to drag it all the way because the sample is not really going to change, so that's where

[05:12] we loop it.

[05:14] Now, from here, you can choose to move some of the notes or play with the velocities.

[05:25] You can also get a more natural sounding one.

[05:38] I'm going to show you guys a super clutch trick that's super easy to implement.

[05:42] One thing you can do is you can grab this guy and from there, command E and turn it

[05:47] into two.

[05:48] So now you get this double hit there, which is going to add even more swap.

[06:04] And since you have this swing applied, this open hat gets that swing, the last one, and

[06:09] that makes a tasty ass boom.

[06:12] What magic.

[06:13] Right.

[06:13] And then you can play with the velocity, too, if you choose.

[06:22] I do have a reverse clap here.

[06:25] It's been making itself known.

[06:27] I'm just going to lower the ball.

[06:30] The purpose of it is to lead you into that last clap, which creates a very nice swag

[06:34] and another variation to it, of course, is to do it every two bars if you choose to.

[06:49] From there, I recommend grabbing loops and chopping up the parts that you like, for

[06:53] example.

[06:57] It's a very heavy loop that has a lot going.

[07:02] However, I don't really want all of that, so what I can do is start to chop to get

[07:05] what I like.

[07:10] Cue it to just grab that rim that I really like the pattern.

[07:30] It's a very dusty loop.

[07:32] Now, the reason that I'm adding loops like this is because I'm trying to fill in the

[07:37] gaps with other style of drums to add flavor.

[07:39] But at the same time, sometimes we might want more.

[07:42] We just don't know. And that's where sample packs will come into play.

[07:45] You should use them as sort of inspiration where you could maybe get inspired and do

[07:49] your own pattern to it.

[07:50] Or maybe you like the tone and texture that the sample provides.

[07:53] Back then, I was super, super strict on not using top loops like this over existing

[07:58] drums because there's always the fear or the risk of canceling out, phasing out, which

[08:03] is where two drums that sound the same hit.

[08:05] And it sounds rather odd.

[08:06] However, after being in some sessions with some more veteran producers that make some

[08:10] bomb music, I've noticed a lot of them don't really care about it.

[08:12] And when I ask, the way it was explained to me is that a lot of the times these drums

[08:16] will add a noise floor.

[08:17] And what that means is without those drums, there's like an empty gap in the song that

[08:22] isn't being filled.

[08:23] And the way they see it, it adds texture.

[08:25] The key thing, of course, is being aware that this can lead to some detrimental issues

[08:30] that will arise with the audio where you're going to find like the audio just sounds a

[08:33] lot shittier. But the question is, is it on purpose and does it add to the character of

[08:38] the song? And that's really up to you to decide what your taste as a producer.

[08:41] From there, I can now start to replace some of the drums in the cork.

[08:50] Now, let's compare.

[08:57] Not bad. And this one just has a lot more character on the snare drum, it doesn't sound

[09:03] so stock, but it doesn't mean the other snare is bad, the other snare has a bit more

[09:06] weight. So that actually tells me something as I compare both and it opens up to my eyes

[09:10] that I maybe need a little more body on this.

[09:32] And of course, I'm making it a case to use the 909 kick drum from Ableton.

[09:35] It's just it's like a like a test to yourself.

[09:38] When you get that thing to sound good, then you know you're a real producer.

[09:45] That's going to be essentially saturated to give it a bit more meat.

[09:49] This is going to make the kick more of a blob, but that's what we want.

[09:52] From there, I'm using this Neutron 4 Transient Shaper for the only fact that it's a

[09:56] multiband. So essentially, it lets me split up the kick into different frequency sides.

[10:00] And then from there, this I can get rid of that nasty noise that whoever at Ableton

[10:07] recorded it. Like you can see, OK, there we can kind of just make it a little clean.

[10:12] From there, I'm shortening it a bit with Kickstart, which is essentially just volume

[10:15] automation. The way you see it, the volume is allowed here at full and then it slowly

[10:19] gets reduced. But from here, I'm using standard clip just to clip off just the tip.

[10:25] The key thing, though, is I don't want to clip the low end because anytime you clip

[10:28] low and it's going to sound like poopoo.

[10:30] So I'm going to ease off. And there we go.

[10:37] That's just controlling that peak because that peak is going to trigger the compressor.

[10:40] So this is just a couple of things that I've done in order to make this be a lot more

[10:43] friendlier to compressors and the limiter on the master.

[10:46] Now, let's talk about the processing of the drums, because this is where I had one of

[10:49] probably the biggest revelations that I've had when it comes to these type of drums.

[10:53] And that is the usage.

[10:54] Little thing called an AK-9X, which is a preamp that is created to mimic the color of

[10:59] an old school Akai sampler.

[11:02] Let me show you when I turn all this off how it sounds.

[11:06] Yeah, so these drums need a bit of love.

[11:08] Let me show you what's really going to give these drums flavor.

[11:10] This is the stuff they don't show you because they just don't want you to have the

[11:14] flavor. They're scared of your ideas because they know you are going to kill it more than

[11:17] they are. Let's not blow someone else's candle to light ours unless they ain't going to

[11:21] show us the goods.

[11:22] The first thing is some compression.

[11:24] This is something that you can write down for yourself that you can always have.

[11:27] And that is going to be a compressor, the glue from Ableton.

[11:29] That is going to be set to a two to one ratio, two for every 2dB that goes over the

[11:33] threshold being hit when the needle moves, 1dB will come out.

[11:36] So it's not going to be that hard.

[11:37] The next thing is the attack can either be 30 or 10.

[11:40] It just really depends on how tight you want your drums to feel.

[11:44] 10 is going to allow for more gain reduction and it's going to grab onto the drum a

[11:47] lot quicker, meaning that it's going to be a lot shorter on the compression.

[11:51] 30, you're going to allow more.

[11:52] And again, it's going to be very minuscule because we're talking about 10

[11:56] milliseconds, 30 milliseconds here.

[11:57] So I'm going to go with a 10 release.

[11:59] We want it fast because if we leave it, that needle takes forever to go down.

[12:04] And with drums, they're fast hitting.

[12:06] Right. So we want this compressor to grab on and do it staying when needed.

[12:09] Now, the way this thing glues is by controlling the volume.

[12:12] If something goes above the threshold, meaning the clap hits a little louder than

[12:15] everything else because it's activating the threshold and nothing else is, then

[12:19] it's going to reduce the volume at that instant when the clap hits or 10

[12:22] milliseconds after it triggers it, meaning the volume gets reduced on the clap,

[12:26] making it feel a lot more glued because the volume isn't like there's not a lot

[12:30] of change in volume inside the drum tape.

[12:32] Saturation is one of those things that's very beautiful, essentially mimicking

[12:35] the idea of recording something to tape.

[12:38] And as something was recorded to tape, there was some saturation that occurred

[12:41] probably doing like someone running hot on it.

[12:43] And this one, I like to use the drum bus preset.

[12:45] And then from there, I'll just play with the input and the output.

[12:48] So, for example, I'm going to lower these down right now so we don't bust.

[13:01] That is how like it sounds louder, yet it's quieter.

[13:04] I mean, the IPS is the color, how fast this is moving, but the lower the number,

[13:08] the more rounded your high end is going to get.

[13:10] So lower values will give you more of a.

[13:14] Type of drums, good for lo-fi, I would say 15 is a good medium of like I'm kind

[13:18] of hippie and old school, but I'm kind of not.

[13:24] And 30, let's let it all out, the high end is just going to be.

[13:32] But I'm going to go with 15 because it gives us more of that 90s flavor, that

[13:36] roundness to to the high end.

[13:49] As I do this, you're going to notice the claps, the drums start to sound more flat.

[13:52] If you want to get range for clipping, I would say no more than two to four dB of

[13:56] clipping occurring.

[13:57] This is coming from a Mendelssohn.

[13:57] 

[13:57] 

[13:58] I have that master's music for a living.

[14:00] I did ask the question because I noticed a lot of people clip and I'll get into

[14:02] some sessions with some people that clip to God's end.

[14:05] You can definitely clip and be all complex about it, but at the end of the day,

[14:08] composure is needed in music.

[14:09] You do so much and you can push stuff to the limit for sure.

[14:13] If it isn't doing anything for your music, then, you know, have the confidence to

[14:16] say this is good enough.

[14:18] Finally, my new favorite plug in for this kind of stuff is AK-9X, which is going to

[14:21] be something that mimics an Akai preamp.

[14:25] The idea of it is, is that when we use that, we can reduce the quality of the

[14:29] sound, the sample for the sake of rounding out the high end.

[14:41] What I want you to pay attention to is this section here.

[14:43] I'm going to turn it on and off and you'll see what it's doing.

[15:03] Now, when we do that, you notice there's a change to the way it sounds, right?

[15:07] And that is the missing key for me personally, as I was trying to get a

[15:11] similar vibe to his drums.

[15:12] Again, I'm not reordering, so I'm not going to sound exactly like him.

[15:15] He can be the best version of himself, but I can still allow myself to learn from it.

[15:19] And this is one of the things I learned that in order to sound the 90s vibe, I

[15:23] need to think like in the 90s.

[15:24] And this plug in here allows me to put the color of this preamp that was in an

[15:29] Akai sampler. So a preamp, you can think about it like the input, the output.

[15:33] For instance, on a microphone, the preamp is meant to boost the gain of the

[15:37] microphone. However, certain preamps will have color to them, a certain curve to

[15:41] them, a certain tone that when you run that mic through it and you push the

[15:45] preamp past a certain point will provide that color, that flavor to it.

[15:48] And that's what we want with this.

[16:00] You can hear the difference like that, and I know a lot of you guys are going,

[16:03] like, oh, what the? If you guys want me to get into the bass, let me know in the

[16:06] comments below. I will break down the bass, the patterns of the bass, what you

[16:09] can learn from it to really put that into your production.
