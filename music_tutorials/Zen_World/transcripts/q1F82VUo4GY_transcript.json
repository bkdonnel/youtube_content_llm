    "text": "Hey, what's up ninjas? Hopefully you guys are having a good holiday season It's currently no chabuena or as I say Mexican Christmas Day because tomorrow for a lot of us It's national hangover day But hopefully you guys are spending it with your family and hopefully you guys are gonna be having a kick-ass time now today We're gonna be getting into serum twos FM section which you're gonna access By clicking the warp and going below distortion where you're gonna find a lot of modulations Like FM which stands for frequency modulation PD, which is the old serum FM known as phase distortion AM Which is amplitude modulation Amplitude just meaning the volume of the sound and then ring modulation are M. So we're gonna be able to route multiple different modulation sources Usually in this scenario, it's gonna be either the oscillator BC the filter outputs sub oscillator and even the noise Okay FM frequency modulation as the name entails. We're modulating the frequency of this oscillator However, it's gonna be done in a way where if you can hear a sound source Like this this sign is moving at a really fast rate So it wouldn't really modulate like we did with the LFO unless we're playing it at a very high rate Or it wouldn't modulate like an envelope. It's gonna modulate so fast that it's gonna produce harmonics like distortion But in its own way, it's gonna add new stuff. So already know the sine wave It's just that little mountain that You know, it's pure innocence and with FM We're gonna add multiple overtones and the way we add them is gonna be dependent on how we program by default We have a through zero activated down here the best way to kind of think of true zero is that the FM will most likely always stay in pitch unless it's being Used at very high values the other thing and I'm gonna quote the serum manual for this causes carrier oscillator Which is this one the one producing the sound to continue to oscillate correctly Even when its frequency is modulated into negative values by the modulator oscillator Okay, the way I like to think about it true. So just really is gonna be the cleaner one It's also gonna be the one that relatively stays more in key and according to serum It's useful for lush metallic or bell like tones to apply the FM We're gonna have oscillator B And keeping to notice the level needs to be down so that we can treat this more as a modulation source rather than a sound However, you can also have it up if you feel it adds to the sound or it's a thing that you might want But from here, I'm gonna have both of these set to an octave of zero to sir Okay, and I'm gonna increase this And as I increase it I want you to take note of the extra harmonics the overtones we're adding besides that fundamental Now Keeping with a fem is that oscillator be right the one that is modulating it It's pitch is very it's gonna affect the way that sounds very dramatically So for example right now, we're gonna have a one-to-one ratio a ratio where they're equal, right? So we're producing more of the same frequency range Okay As this one however the higher this octave goes which would increase the FM ratio That just means again instead of 101 now, this one's up above so it would be one or two Harmonics harmonics that sound even higher right and this is how I like to tweet a femme if you want a bit of theory The higher this one goes up the more it's gonna introduce a higher tone. However, let's say that you're using that first one for a baby Yes, it's good to note here you can see that this And the two and even the one where it's equal are a lot Since we're doing FM now serums allowing us to change the way the pitch reacts for our oscillator so the way we can change it is by right-clicking and Going into mode and now we have three different modes Harmonics ratio is what most FM synthesizers that we know of out there use first thing I want to do is I want to go source and pick the oscillator that's gonna be producing the sound So in this scenario, it's gonna be oscillator a what this is gonna do is if I move this This oscillator is gonna follow it For example here if I'm playing a C and I put the ratio of two I'm gonna have this guy be an octave above If I put it at three We're now in the fifth put it at four And now two octaves five We're on that third, which is the e6 you already know Get that g7 Now we're at an a-sharp now all of this only starts to matter when I'm using a fam Okay And one thing to note to us using an envelope on the FM is very common in FM synthesis Sometimes you want that tone, but you don't want it forever So this is when you use an envelope to apply it to the beginning of a sound or throughout the song But it starts to decrease the more the sound plays Like here it's going from an F to an E Assemble one get put to the F sharp When I'm playing the F key This is frequency modulation Even though it doesn't sound like it and I can prove it to you because if we lower the pitch of this guy down to Really low where it turns into a low oscillator like these guys over here. You're gonna hear And it creates static tones Again those are key things to put into mind We're gonna be making some sounds at the end of this video as always to put this knowledge to use because with a fam Right knowing what sounds we can make with it does help a bit and knowing what we can do with it and when to use It up below that we're gonna have through zero to exponential. Okay, so Exponential linear right all that's gonna do is it's gonna change the way the FM is applied So here I have this graph of an exponential Which we would call can also call the compound interest So if you ever into finance or like investing you'll hear people compounding interest is the way to get rich and all this stuff Yeah, so it's because it's gonna like as you can see it starts off similar to a linear But then it starts to go faster and faster the more to the right we go and eventually it just blows up This leads to the FM as you move it sounding a lot more drastic Versus a linear one is gonna be as you can see just constantly going at its pace or exponent Linear I want to quote something with the serum to manual which explains a couple of things which I don't know from what I hear It doesn't feel too true. But again, it could be issues. Maybe I'm just not doing it, right? Linear is often described as smooth clean and more musical Compared to other femme types such as exponential this makes it great for bell like tones pads and other complex but stable timbres And this is what I mean like I'll do linear and move around But it feels like it goes out of key in fact the one that doesn't is the true zero I Find true sir is the one that keeps its its key a lot better. For example, the one that is linear or exponential It's the kind you'll find like on a Jupiter 6 or Jupiter 8 sin Like if you use the Arturia stuff, there's this cross mod one that you can use And This sounds exactly like it the next warp we have is gonna be the PD which stands for face Distortion, so you're pretty much gonna be altering the face Of the sound with another Oscillator, so for instance here this to this to me. It sounds very similar to FM And Similar to FM The pitch and the ratios matter This is a traditional sermon FM and the way I like to see it Remember if you like the sounds most people were making with sermon when they did FM on there Then usually you want to go with the PD the face distortion over the Traditional FM you're gonna be able to route the seed the noise the sub the filter outputs and its own self now Which back then you couldn't do and I've never heard with that it So I'm gonna assume this is a feedback Because in some FM sounds to create the iconic sauce sound like the lately bass It would have to feed back into itself in order to produce something that sounded almost like a saw and This sounds exactly like it Now to the bottom of that we have amplitude Modulation similar to FM except the amplitude the volume is modulated this guy here now I can show you that it's actual volume automation because if I again lower this one all the way down Gonna see that it's the volume starts to Next thing we have is ring modulation You Now the best way to think about ring modulation, it's gonna be the multiplication of both of these guys So again, we're dealing here with like the pitch now with RM. Usually the way I like to think about it is at low values It provides movement to a sound But at high volumes the problem that starts to occurs as you multiply so you start to create Instability in the sound making it sound more atonal making it good for Sound the same of drums sound the same for techno sound the same of metallic objects instead of it Sounding harmonically rich like the face distortion with RM. You're creating more of a hollow sound You're creating more of a metallic sound and unstable sound. So when I say unstable just See it like this, right? I have two sauce here. They're stable. They're playing the same note But the moment that I get one out of key I Starts to sound very unstable now, let's bring another one into the equation You know, it's not gonna be melodic we're not gonna go that sounds beautiful now we're gonna see that sounds fierce that sounds aggressive now Serum twos manual doesn't really explain ring modulation But I guess the best way to kind of see it is the ring modulation as we said, right? It's gonna distort It's gonna ruin harmonic relationships making it sound atonal and it does that because what it's doing it's gonna be multiplying between these two, right? We're gonna get the sum of both Oscillators and the difference and then we produce new frequencies out of it, which are not going to be related harmonically Those are gonna be our more advanced warp modulations that we have that I wanted to talk about later Now the crazy thing about serum 2 is that it allows you to actually a femme Sounds like for instance sampled bass sounds similar to Ableton Ableton also allows you to do that For example, if I have a brass sound here So the way that I use that in my sound design is sometimes I'll create Sounds that are normal right like a guitar like a brass shot. I'm like use it as a brass shot However, I always like to add mods for this stuff because as you can hear You Can create some really crazy sounds with a sample getting a femme from a saw like it's crazy to me like it's insane And this is when you would use a sub I always get asked a lot by people I wouldn't use a sub in production stuff So as a sound designer for me use a sub when you have a sound that you like the tone of but it's gonna be Impossible to mix low and into it and even then let's say you were able To mix low and into it by the usage of a high shelf boost or a bell EQ There's always trade-offs when you're EQ in when you're boosting by huge amounts You can cause your frequencies to last longer than it should which is what you will people will refer to as ringing frequencies, right? You can cause phase shifts with like extreme EQ shifts So a lot of the times you want to avoid that right and you avoid it by using a sine wave as your sub So we're gonna do that here. We're gonna put it Probably at the same sub range as this because if we look at the EQ There is sub frequency there, but it's just not as good and it's also pulsating It's constantly moving which means that if we want that effect that works But if we want a constant low end to be felt in the car in the club, then we want to use a sine wave That's gonna be playing Now do I have to cut out the frequencies from this guy in order to do that? No, because what tends to happen with phase cancellation, which is what most people want to deal with is it's relative to volume So what that means is that if the subs in this sound aren't as loud as the sub I'm about to put There's low risk and of cancelling out and also if cancellation does occur, right? They they cancel each other out It's not gonna be like a complete serial cancellation it's gonna be a very minimal one because the sub isn't as loud So now let's put some reverb I'm on a legato portamento. I'm gonna have this increase We're gonna add this crossfade Set an LFO, let's just get fancy with it The other one was fine, but we're gonna add a bit of an LFO moving at a slow rate I really don't know what I want. And in that scenario if I don't know what I want, that's fine I'm just gonna use the again the random curved here or the random flat and use the smooth feature Dick okay the reaver by the way, it's a clutch in the sense that You know, we put it because it makes anything sound good. So Trolling these frequencies more since the sound moves around a lot We do want the extreme compression right that the serum to man who states this is So we're just gonna essentially change the tonality of everything by moving these guys up and down Now as I create the sound I'm noticing there's a lack of mid-low In order to access those mid-lows I might try to look for another wavetable that's gonna allow us to Add them in like possibly a monster one. That's gonna be static with that Now too much I guess we could say there's a lot too much overtones on it right too much high-end So we're gonna use a low pass and we're also gonna use a high pass to move some of the low end from it I'm trying to see if there's any way to make the sound more interesting Let's Add a filter now that's gonna provide that interestingness to it You Know what bees let's make a bass So we can do the standard deep house bass as well with this and I'm going to show you guys some of the techniques here That we can use for example The FM can be modulated and a lot of FM since they do modulate it So the way we would do that is route envelope 2 which is gonna be the more traditional route and then we're gonna have it Just open up and then come back to a starting position to give us a nice punchy deep houses This is PD itself  Random fairy trigger You I want to add like a slap delay to this very iconic of back in the day when we had you know EDX and all that good stuff. Another common technique is modulation of the pitches to add that pitch envelope shift that we did even I forgot to lower down the level of the second oscillator. Let's add this nice click layer to it. I'm looking for something that gives this more of a feel of like it's botanical like it's a drum so we're going to go with that conga try that let's make it wide okay now I am going to add OTT the moment you add OTT it might turn into a lap house bass let's add some reverb to this that sounds nice reminds you of those botanical sounds so now and again we're getting crazy here because we don't really have an end goal what we're trying to create so that's why I'm like just going crazy which is again if you want to make precise sounds always have a strategy when you're doing sound design but here I'm just trying to show you guys all the little things I've learned over the years from studying some of my favorite sound designers and some of my favorite packs like Equinox sounds had this botanical pack that was really dope and I loved and they would use a lot of combs to get the this sounding like this now I'm going to add this note so that it's key tracked such a beautiful sound right and we have to control them in and the reverb of course let's go with like a convolution which we talked about this is a good example where I might want to use it because I want to make it feel botanical I'm looking for something that I can't get with this so let's see let's try the weird one let's say I want more high-frequency on this then I'll open up the filter or increase the really nice sound so we made deep house bass we made a botanical pluck we made something like that I don't know what you would use that for I would work more on the mixing of it of course I would want it to sound a little bit more warmer and of course I would go back to my sound design and I would figure out why it sounds cold hey guys so this is gonna be the complete guide to master serum we went over some of the advanced modulations found in the warp section and now you should be able to use them with confidence so experiment with them make sounds with them to see what they can do and most important of all have fun you guys take care and you guys have a great rest of your day",
