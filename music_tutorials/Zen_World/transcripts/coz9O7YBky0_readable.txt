[00:00] Beep, beep. Yo, what's up, ninjas?

[00:02] Welcome to the Complete Guide to Master Serum.

[00:04] Today, we are going into a section which it's above my pay grade,

[00:07] but I feel like I can explain it in a way where it will make sense to most of you.

[00:11] And from there, if you want to become experts at it,

[00:14] then make a plug in by that point, because to become an expert

[00:16] at the wavetable editor, you got to know how to input formulas and math.

[00:20] And I only got to calculus.

[00:21] And after that, I said sayonara.

[00:23] The way to access the wavetable editor, guys, is going to be pretty simple.

[00:28] We've already seen the pencil.

[00:30] OK, so I'm going to put this down here.

[00:32] So we're going to access it by going to the saw top right.

[00:35] Boom. That little pencil button.

[00:38] Now, the purpose of the wavetable editor is to create your own wavetables,

[00:40] which we already know is the color of your sound.

[00:43] And from there, we can also create custom morphs, custom tables

[00:47] with multiple sub tables, which are going to be here.

[00:50] Number four, five, six, seven, eight, all the way to up to nine

[00:53] for this whole wavetable in order to morph between them.

[00:57] Or to provide yourself or your users, in essence, a certain color palette

[01:02] like you can call this like the sky palette, right?

[01:05] Light blue, blue and purple and orange and yellow.

[01:08] And then that's the palette. That's the wavetable.

[01:10] OK, so we can do that with that.

[01:12] Now, with the sine wave, which we've talked about is a purest waveform.

[01:14] If I were to play a note, let's say here like the A at a very low octave

[01:19] where it's bass, you can see that I'm hitting fifty four point nine hertz.

[01:23] Now, the thing at the very top of Serum 2 that you can notice here,

[01:25] all these bins are going to be related to the harmonics,

[01:29] the frequency of the sound at the very beginning.

[01:30] We have been one, which is my fundamental, which is just going to be that.

[01:34] Now, every note is going to be associated with a certain frequency.

[01:37] And if you see there's these little gray outlines here,

[01:39] these gray islands are just going to signify the A at different octaves.

[01:43] So pretty much here we're a one.

[01:45] This is going to be the A2.

[01:46] We can highlight here and you're going to see A2 from here.

[01:49] You're going to highlight this A3.

[01:51] OK, there we go.

[01:52] Then we're going to have a four and then we're going to have a five

[01:57] and then we're going to have a six and then, you know,

[02:01] we have a nice little organ sound.

[02:02] That's how this top part pertains.

[02:04] Now, everything in between that, you can kind of think a bit about it

[02:07] like a piano keyboard is the notes in between the harmonics in between

[02:10] the semitones in between and between the tone.

[02:13] So what this is all going to be about is creating wavetables, right?

[02:18] In theory, if you create something like this that comes from the top down,

[02:22] like this, you should be able to create like a saw type of sound.

[02:26] It sounds like a saw, like a foot, but you should be able to create a saw.

[02:31] If I right click, I believe here I can generate a saw, as you're going to see.

[02:35] And there it is.

[02:36] Now, at the bottom of that is going to be the relationship

[02:39] on phase for each harmonic that you have.

[02:42] OK, and this is where you're going to control it.

[02:46] OK, I can also choose to generate a saw here.

[02:48] And you can see that. OK, cool.

[02:51] We have a saw and it's just randomized,

[02:54] which will give us different results, randomized.

[02:56] Boom. We can also randomize the top.

[02:58] We can randomize the bottom.

[03:00] So you can see there. Boom.

[03:03] So this is cool for generating really cool tones.

[03:07] You can see this one here.

[03:10] Kind of normalizing itself.

[03:12] You're going to be able to randomize or create a saw or a clear

[03:16] the band, so pretty much a low, like you can remove all the high harmonics clear.

[03:22] So it's like a high. Right.

[03:24] And then if I have all the low ones, let's say, and I just want to make it less

[03:28] savvy if I'm playing low.

[03:33] So so we have those there.

[03:35] Let's knit again, go back to our trusty sign.

[03:38] So from there, progressive fade.

[03:41] So if I have something, I believe as the name entails, right,

[03:43] we're going to progressively fade, which I hope my barber does when he cuts my hair.

[03:48] You know, I want to see it progressively fade.

[03:51] You know, I don't want to see a sudden fade. Right.

[03:53] But if we do progressive fade, it's just boom.

[03:56] We can shift it up an octave.

[04:00] We can shift it down an octave.

[04:05] OK.

[04:09] Can always go back to the trusty saw.

[04:11] If you find you make a poo poo type of wave tables and then we can repeat the bin group.

[04:17] So pretty much from from from

[04:21] at the very bottom, we have these sections draw even harmonics only.

[04:24] So as I'm drawing, let's say here,

[04:27] I'm only going to draw the even ones, which are going to be

[04:33] something tasty.

[04:34] And we can draw odd harmonics as well, which is going to be more of a square type of sound.

[04:41] Let's go down like this.

[04:45] It's more of a square, almost like a guy making a synth

[04:48] and you want to provide very strong harmonics.

[04:51] We can right click and scale frequency values by bin index, which I prefer,

[04:55] to be fair, because it doesn't make it look so tiny.

[04:58] So I'm going to turn that on one more time.

[05:02] Boom. Now I can see a lot better.

[05:05] Like there is a ceiling to it at the very top.

[05:08] A hundred boom, if we do random boom.

[05:17] OK, I have that scale frequency on.

[05:19] So that helps a lot in making this stuff.

[05:21] When we randomize, you make a lot of these

[05:23] very like buzzy like sounds, which sound very electric

[05:27] can also work for dubstep, I would say, because, for example, here,

[05:31] if I can randomize this one as well and I go from this to this,

[05:35] I can create a morph by going now into processes

[05:40] and morph and then do a crossfade between these two here.

[05:53] Now, the way I use the top in the most for my sound design work,

[05:56] I'll click here and usually I'm using it to make organ based sounds.

[06:03] You know, maybe I'll like have something like this where I want.

[06:09] You know, a little bit of these middle, which are not related to the fundamental,

[06:15] but provide more body to the sound.

[06:20] From there, at the bottom, we can also draw in our wave tables.

[06:23] For example, here, we're going to have our brush settings

[06:25] and here we're going to have our wave table.

[06:27] OK, so we can have a sign, for example.

[06:29] So each note here can turn into a wave.

[06:30] Turn into a sign like so, you know, it's almost like there.

[06:34] I wouldn't like this guy being my barber just saying, OK,

[06:37] we're going to have this little ramp up.

[06:41] I notice as I do it, it's all going to pertain

[06:43] and be focused on these little grids that which we can control here by moving down.

[06:48] So that way I can have this and it's literally just drawing it.

[06:53] Or I can select the grid of one to one, which is just going to input the shape.

[06:58] One to one like this, boom, made us all like that easy.

[07:03] Concave, then I can start to use the other ones at the bottom,

[07:06] which will work on what you have.

[07:09] And essentially make the shape less stiff.

[07:14] Or give it a certain.

[07:17] Move and we can also nudge and we can add the noise.

[07:21] So if you're making tear out dubstep,

[07:24] this is what you would probably want to be using.

[07:27] Which creates the buzzy sound.

[07:29] OK, so now as you're creating your wave table,

[07:32] your sub tables here, as we were talking about that in the beginning.

[07:36] Right. They don't have to do this by.

[07:42] Default, right, you can have a select color palette,

[07:45] but the goal, if you're making a way to that, you want to, let's say, make a path.

[07:52] Then definitely you want some smoothness to it.

[07:54] So that's where the right side is going to come into play,

[07:59] because this is where you're going to apply the morph

[08:01] once you've created all your sub tables.

[08:04] And this is where you're going to process either single sub tables.

[08:08] For instance, we have a normalized, which is going to make it so that

[08:10] you make the amplitude of that wave at least hit the ceiling.

[08:14] So whichever comes first, that will hit the ceiling

[08:17] and then it will stop to increase the volume.

[08:20] From there, you can remove the DC offset,

[08:22] which usually occurs with heavy distortion.

[08:25] We can flip the polarity.

[08:29] In vertical or horizontal, we can shift the horizontal zero crossing

[08:33] so we can make it essentially smoother as it transitions from this side to that side.

[08:38] We can knit it, which is what I was looking for last time.

[08:42] We can fade in the edges.

[08:45] Boom, slight and let's see here.

[08:48] X-fade edges similar to the one, just a different option.

[08:52] We can filter it.

[08:53] So it's almost like a low pass filter.

[08:55] A lot of times you can get the filter on the whole thing,

[08:57] which almost makes it like a low pass filter.

[09:01] We can sample Redux grid size to the grid size.

[09:04] So, for instance, if I go 20 like that crazy and then we sample Redux,

[09:08] we can essentially square it, make it sound like almost like it's getting

[09:12] lower in quality or crunching it a lot.

[09:15] And then we can send to the noise oscillator,

[09:17] which I didn't know you could do that. And it's here.

[09:23] So we go, we can key track that as well by I believe

[09:30] there is somewhere to key track boom.

[09:34] But again, like I said, with a lot of sounds that you can hear

[09:38] that sound cool, they're usually playing at a very low octave.

[09:42] So that's where we hear that at the serial pitch.

[09:44] But if we go high enough, we'll eventually start to hear

[09:54] the sound itself.

[09:55] The next one is going to be for all the sub tables that you have.

[09:59] So, for instance, the first one is normalize each gain separately,

[10:02] which premature we did with single each one.

[10:05] So I'm just going to look at each one and normalize.

[10:07] What that means is the at least one of these has to hit the edge

[10:12] and then that's normalization.

[10:13] You just kind of put it at max amplitude.

[10:15] And if something touches the tip, it stops growing.

[10:19] I was going to make a joke, but you get it stops.

[10:22] It doesn't keep going.

[10:22] So if I do each, each one's going to do it individually, reach the tip.

[10:27] So it reaches it here.

[10:28] It reaches the top here again.

[10:31] It can also hit the bottom first here, right here.

[10:35] We can undo that by, I believe, just hitting the undo here.

[10:40] Boom. OK, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[10:42] And then the bottom one is between all of them.

[10:46] So whichever hits first, even if some of them don't reach their max amplitude

[10:51] again, it's going to be based on all of them as a whole and then all.

[10:57] So, again, these are going to affect most of them.

[11:00] This is where I have to go into the manual to give you guys some definitions.

[11:07] This is above my pay grade.

[11:10] Not to say I don't use this stuff when I'm making wave tables,

[11:12] but it's more of an experimental thing of like, what does this do?

[11:16] Ah, that sounded cool.

[11:17] Not to play around with the rest.

[11:18] What I'm going to do is I'm going to go into spectral

[11:21] and I'm going to copy some of these waveforms like this one.

[11:23] I'm going to go to oscillator B.

[11:26] OK, so I have one.

[11:28] So I'm going to paste the one I just copied here.

[11:31] I'm going to go back, select another wave table from from here.

[11:36] See, let's go just here to a monster one like here.

[11:41] Boom. So we have these three right now, three sub tables.

[11:45] We can first off, filter them all

[11:48] to make them more subby.

[11:54] Can remove the fundamental, which becomes very useful

[11:56] for when you're making bass lines, you remove that first note,

[12:00] which if you're playing low enough will usually be the bass,

[12:03] the sub part of the bass.

[12:04] So if you're layering multiple bass tones together, you can use that

[12:08] so that you don't have a low end that's fluctuating in volume, beating, detuning.

[12:13] So that's where that becomes useful.

[12:17] From there, below that, we have remove low spectra grid size.

[12:20] From what I read in the manual, it's going to pertain, as you saw here,

[12:23] remove all of this.

[12:25] OK, we'll go back

[12:28] from there, the other one, remove low faces,

[12:30] which is only the bottom one, as you saw here.

[12:33] OK, so again, that bottom one controls the phases

[12:36] as we were talking about the phase, the position of each.

[12:39] You know, harmonic that we're adding.

[12:43] OK, below that, we can sample redox

[12:46] all of them, so we create that crunch effect on them all.

[12:51] OK, as we keep going down, we can resize tables to half the number.

[12:55] So one more time, as you can see, we multiplied it to two.

[12:59] Instead of one, oh, good thing we have an undo.

[13:04] One more time, we have we have three, so we're going to boom,

[13:08] half each one and create.

[13:10] Three new wave tables.

[13:13] And if I want to go through.

[13:19] Super cool, you make the most out of each one.

[13:21] We're going to do that one more time.

[13:23] We keep going.

[13:25] We can also resize half.

[13:27] So it's going to make it to one or two, as you can see.

[13:30] And we hear this one, we end.

[13:33] So it's cool because it's like experimental in nature

[13:36] and allows you to create more from what you have, which I think is pretty cool.

[13:39] From there, we can create a PWM pulse with modulation out of the one

[13:43] we've selected.

[13:44] So what that is, usually it's going to be

[13:47] the shift of the middle

[13:49] to the left, which sounds super cool.

[13:52] It's more fratty movement.

[13:53] And you also have the PWM, which we talked about in one of the earlier episodes.

[13:58] Similar to it.

[14:01] In order to add more movement to a sound, sounds very futuristic.

[14:05] OK, here we have set spectra, this frame in all.

[14:12] Boom, you can see that the top part there.

[14:16] Boom, it's changing to this,

[14:18] so we're turning like that frequency to all of them,

[14:22] but the phase below stays the same.

[14:30] We can set the phases, this frame in all,

[14:32] and we can do the other oscillators as well.

[14:34] We can subtract spectra from the other oscillators,

[14:37] so that's going to pertain to the other one.

[14:38] So pretty cool.

[14:39] From there, we can blur.

[14:46] Them from there at the bottom, we have the more section,

[14:49] which is the more important section I would feel if you must know anything,

[14:53] it would definitely be that section, because this section is what's going

[14:56] to allow you to morph these three to create a full out wavetable

[14:59] with 256 essentially images to it.

[15:03] So if I'm more crossfade, you can see now I'm at 256, which is the max.

[15:10] And we've created a wavetable, a wub style of table, right?

[15:15] Very easily.

[15:16] If I undo that now, right, I remove that whole

[15:21] morph and I'm stuck with the tone palette.

[15:23] I think about it like this.

[15:24] I can go through all the colors now.

[15:26] I have a couple of ways to morph spectral and crossfade.

[15:29] So now I can use spectral.

[15:35] Guys, you can see there and then we have zero fun face.

[15:41] So the fundamental, the phase of the fundamental is set to zero

[15:45] and then we can also zero all the phases.

[15:47] So I'm going back here.

[15:49] So all the faces, boom, as you can see here,

[15:52] we lose all of these that we've added before,

[15:55] which creates like a dinner sound.

[15:58] Personally, spectral first one is the best one.

[16:02] And the crossfade

[16:03] with that in mind, let's make some wavetables.

[16:08] And as we make them, I'll explain the rest of the stuff that pertains to them.

[16:12] So I'm going to remove all the wavetables by clicking here.

[16:19] Clicking there.

[16:21] OK, I am going to put a sign,

[16:24] which I believe if we go to a certain section, we can put down here a formula

[16:29] where we can just get the sign and then we have all these.

[16:32] And this is the part where I'm talking about, like you can get into the math stuff.

[16:35] Like, for instance, here, there's one called Michelangelo waves.

[16:38] Like, what is that?

[16:40] I mean, if someone understands all that, that's great.

[16:45] I don't understand.

[16:47] I recognize the terms.

[16:48] I just don't know how it all makes sense together.

[16:50] But it's there, the Fibonacci.

[16:58] Yeah, just math, math, math, bro.

[17:00] So you can definitely do that.

[17:01] However, for me, for us mere mortals,

[17:04] I'm going to go and just generate a nice little saw for me.

[17:08] Then I'm going to click all and I'm going to remove everything except that one there.

[17:12] I believe I should be able to do that.

[17:14] Remove all except selected single removal somewhere here.

[17:18] Maybe I can right click on it.

[17:24] Move all but selected.

[17:26] Oh, there we go. Remove.

[17:30] All except selected.

[17:32] So here you're going to be able to remove and you have various different ways to do it.

[17:36] You can select multiple and remove.

[17:37] You can remove everything from beginning to the selected

[17:41] from the selected to the end and vice versa.

[17:44] And then we can also reduce the way from there.

[17:46] So from here, we start with a sign.

[17:50] Let's see what we can make.

[17:52] So I'm just going to start putting stuff in.

[17:57] When a set frequency by index, it's a lot easier for me to make something

[18:01] that doesn't sound too fucked up.

[18:05] Just trying to get a certain tone.

[18:08] I think it sounds pretty cool.

[18:13] I want more low end.

[18:14] There we go.

[18:16] See if we can add some more phase changes here.

[18:21] When I click, let's see if we can boom.

[18:41] OK, make another one.

[18:44] Maybe this one gets fuzzier.

[18:51] Just to draw it in.

[19:06] Sure. Let's make a little square.

[19:20] It's a hell of a morph.

[19:33] Trying to shape it better.

[19:43] Just undo those.

[19:45] It's this one.

[19:53] Lost a bit of the fuzziness.

[20:01] I'm gonna set this like a wave there we go let's try applying like a flange see what

[20:22] we can move but now go we can I forgot to mention this last time but we can grab wavetables

[20:31] and turn them to full shapes there you go maybe we go the other one add a sub because

[20:50] we are missing it

[20:55] add some good old OTT that's the cheat code to life

[21:24] let's see if we can make this more interesting

[21:39] we got that cool sound if I wanted to add more mid-lows I could there's a bit lacking

[22:00] here so I can either choose to put in another sine there we go that's bringing us to life

[22:07] now we're in a different ballgame now we're with the pros we're fucking with the pros

[22:14] as they say why don't we try adding a convolution reverb and let's remove this we're gonna use

[22:23] the low split high so that way I can target more of the highs with that cab again one

[22:32] more time just to give it a tone on top I already committed to this so I'm gonna choose

[22:48] to go forward with creativity I find if you like your ideas to do that go for it there's

[22:53] no right or wrong let's make one more for this one I want to teach some other stuff

[23:17] on wavetables because right now the way we have wavetables it's fun but there's a funner

[23:23] way of doing it where it's not so complicated so for example to have a sine I'm gonna FM or PD

[23:29] phase distort from B so I'll create the standard that tone I can also back in the day hopefully

[23:38] we can still do it I can go to the menu and I can resample which it looks like render oscillator

[23:45] warp a or resample oscillator a right so I can render the warp so we're gonna resample to a so

[23:55] now that shape that we had there is here right so boom so I can copy that since we have an oscillator

[24:04] see I'm gonna use see us the one where I'm gonna drop all the tones I'm gonna create I'm gonna

[24:09] paste that there boom so now let's see what else can we do to this guy maybe we can go further so

[24:18] now I'm gonna do the same resample to oscillator a warp to there so now we have the sound you heard

[24:27] so now again I'm gonna copy it's no faster way of doing this would be dope too by the way paste

[24:33] that there's now we have something smooth cool we have that sound now let's try undoing that

[24:38] because I don't like where it went but I'm still gonna follow it because again with creativity you

[24:42] can't overthink them again I don't know what I'm gonna get out of this but my goal is to create

[24:47] something cool smooth creating wavetables is an art in its own as you can see so now the bend

[24:54] is in the wavetable right so then if I wanted to have that boom copy that copy it somewhere

[25:05] interesting see boom Oh lost

[25:19] okay it decided to ruin I think I fucked up but it's okay we can follow that maybe it's a gift

[25:25] from God or the universe so I'm gonna go here I like the idea of this one or there we go that

[25:33] one boom we're gonna copy that go to see make a new one bam bam paste boom make a new ones make

[25:40] a new one here for this one let's see we're gonna do let's do an ephemera of PD again with another

[25:47] with a sign keep it simple sample to a boom and then we're gonna copy that C will paste

[26:03] and there we have four okay so now I can remove these for three tones I've decided on let's play

[26:16] let's just make this one a little bit more like so and now what I want to do is I'm gonna either

[26:28] one grab all of them and either do my processing with it so let's fade the edges in from there

[26:36] again you can use any of these I'm gonna choose to I mean I should be happy with that maybe these

[26:43] guys here are set so that it transitions smoother so let's see I mean yeah they sound very similar

[26:51] now let's undo that though because I'm not a fan of that sound we could try the this one I mean I

[27:00] like the these guys I don't like these so I could just have that I'd be dope but nope how about we

[27:08] make six out of the ones we have there we go okay still not happy with that so we're just gonna morph

[27:22] crossfade so that's cool so now it's like we're going from this very bassy harmonic sound to that

[27:34] and we find a pocket right so that first wave table I would say could use a bit of filtering

[27:47] so I'm gonna actually gonna single and filter it a bit fade edges filter and also the middle one

[27:57] we're gonna do that as well

[28:07] now well let's use some alts here and make something we'll see what we come up with

[28:23] there we go I want to go slower

[28:33] got a good tone let's see if some distortion will help add maybe some more but I want to

[28:39] be careful because if I add too much distortion it becomes more of those buzzy ones that we were

[28:55] let's try I need something it's gonna give us life but not too much okay let's put a

[29:07] 

[29:16] I'm gonna go matrix bipolar

[29:31] just once I get something cool

[29:53] I really don't know what I want here I'm thinking because I'm already at a point

[30:03] with the sound where it's cool but it's missing that wow factor

[30:13] definitely need a sub maybe we need more dynamic movement better maybe we go

[30:28] flange comb could possibly work there we go it's a little funky I always like

[30:51] these type of sounds I don't know why slower the resonance okay we got distortion we need

[31:03] more low end less yeah and we're gonna OTT it I always like looking at my span it helps

[31:22] put some more voices I have femming because I feel like I want more upper harmonics on

[31:34] it so that's what I'm gonna do it let's try doing it might be too much movement but I

[31:54] need mids bro I don't need more highs that's what it's saying oh man it's gonna be one

[32:03] of those sounds that yeah just kind of like just went too crazy with it but it's all good

[32:10] we're gonna finish it I'm gonna add some mid-lows maybe we try some form of movement here remove

[32:22] this let's add some reverb put some makeup on this I'm gonna add a saw usually that works

[32:42] 

[32:49] PDA

[32:59] that's a lot better

[33:07] move that

[33:08] that's a thing man

[33:17] more OTTs, maybe distort more here

[33:26] let's move this guy slight

[33:32] some echo might be dope

[33:36] nevermind, nevermind

[33:38] trying out different stuff or restart the sound if i don't like where i'm headed with it

[33:50] mechanical

[34:05] fun all right guys i hope you guys have been enjoying the complete guide to master's serum

[34:08] next video i believe we're gonna be finishing up serum 2 from a standpoint of view of mastering

[34:14] maybe the wavetable editor not so much but like i said before wavetable editor it's a whole art in

[34:19] its own something definitely to get into if it intrigues you i i say go for it uh but with that

[34:23] being said i'll catch you guys next time for another video you guys take care and much love
