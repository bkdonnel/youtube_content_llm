    "text": "Yo what's up ninjas and welcome to the complete guide to Master Serum Dos. Okay now in the first episode we went over the wavetable oscillators there's a couple of things we missed that I do want to touch on real quick. The first one being that if you ever have a wavetable that let's for example this default shapes where you want it to smoothly transfer between the flavors the sounds that you are provided so that you can add movement or do some funky stuff you can always right click on the wavetable position knob and create smooth interpolation this will make it so that let's say we play a saw we can smoothly crossfade between all of them the other thing we forgot to mention here is in the pitch oscillator if you've ever wanted to know how it feels like to do euro synths right the fancy stuff the guys that are obsessed with plugging holes not in the way that most of us do but you know they like plugging holes in their own way then you can do something they do which is when they have an oscillator they don't have a pitch track they have to connect the hole to get the pitch track for us we can do this which allows us to just play this oscillator at any key and it won't change in pitch the reason you might want to do something like this is just because you're looking at this more as from a sound design perspective of creating drones of creating cool things for example one thing these guys do that sometimes feels a little hard with these synths that we have here like like serum 2 is they'll do these crazy drone like sounds but many people don't realize that you can play a lot of these wave tables at very low volumes look at that and you can hear the movement very low low low low frequency where we can hear the movement the in between of the sound and sometimes we can get really cool so that's some unison look at that like if i was doing sound the same for jurassic park i would probably go somewhere down here find the right wave table maybe a little okay so that's why we might want to do something like that not to say that you can't just do it here right but this is how i would create those atmospheres like this let's say for some reason you know like but with that being said let's get into the good stuff the new stuff the multi-sample and the sample section of serum 2 which is going to allow you to play samples let's say you buy a sample pack like one of mine's let's say and there's a nice synth shot in there you're like i like this i want to use it but i want to process it with serum that this is for you to access these new features you just click on the wave table and then you get the sub menu where you can dive into these guys so we'll start with the multi-sample now multi-sample is super clutch i've been using it to create these instruments for you guys in some of the preset packs if you haven't noticed but now i can go to my analog synths i can record multiple hits of a sound i created on them at c3 at a low octave at a mid octave at a high so that way as you play it for instance here i have this one called avicii lives you can see that if i play a low key i'm playing more down here and if i go to the middle this is moving up here now if i click here you're going to see the sample it's a blob but as i move you can see that the sample changes so a multi-sample instrument is going to allow us to play or pretty much create something that is made up of multiple samples and from there we need to program a text file which is known as a dot sfc in order to let serum to know what notes pertain to what sample okay so for example i just did this goddamn preset for minimal night street which was a pain in the butt right so for this i had to sample a hammond b3 just like the original song and from there i created a multi-sample of different hits here okay so again i had to do that with a sfc file now the way that this works i'm going to bring up my folder real quick you can hear multi-sample patches essentially here i have all of the recordings that i've had for my synths so for instance for the moga or the ob6 wiggle wiggle bass i recorded at b0 b1 b2 b3 c0 c1 c2 c3 usually going from like c to e to g you know you decide how you want it you could go from c1 to c2 to c3 or you can get very specific but from there you need create you need to create this file this called visual studio code you can use this in order like for instance here i created this guy you can use this to tell it program it so that serum will see it so for example here i have this dot sfc file which is pretty much is going to give you this here now i use chat gpt to help me do this thank god for chat there's also automators out there that people have created for you to do this if you ever choose to do it for me as a sound designer that's providing sounds for some of the top producers out there and and when i say that i mean you of course is um it's allowing me it's giving me the ability to use my analog synths which i only use for sample creation and for jamming out in a fun different way than using software but now i can create sounds on them grab the characteristics of the synths and again as you saw boom and and provide sounds for them to create stuff like this so now serum is going to provide you with a factory you know collection of sounds they've created so the bass pick palm now serum cares more than i do because as you can see there's multiple rows here so what that means is that these this sfc file is velocity sensitive so what velocity is how hard a notice hit if you have a midi keyboard you know like like for instance i'm rocking this one here if i play soft it sounds like that but if i play hard you know it sounds like that you can you can feel it you know the intensity increases so they recorded some dude with probably long hair on a guitar playing really softly like so now that they told chat or they programmed it into the sfc file saying okay this is the soft hit and then they also program and record it again multiple different takes at different intensities and you get a multi-sample instrument that sounds like this it sounds very lively okay so in the factory you're going to be able to find all kinds you have the choir so if you're making techno right like you can create a nice lead out of this with put effects on it super nicely uh there's drums here like the 909 where each key will play like each drum again the serum 2 went from being a synth to a super synth in a sense and a super sampler um this is all cool stuff i don't know if i would use it but you have access to it and it's good to know just in case you know you ever like just want to be you know cheap instead of eating cup of noodles you know you don't buy that sample pack and and then just use this so that way you know you don't you have money to go to starbucks or something get yourself a nice little nice little chicken popper you know those thing go bop all right some settings to to understand obviously we have our pitch which is going to work very similar to the wavetable oscillators but now we have here this little envelope that we can come in and we can override the envelope that the original creator of this multi-sample instrument um input it so with an sfc file you can also tell it how you want each of these samples to play in terms of envelopes so with this you can override it to have it play the way you want coming out of this okay and this is useful because if i have another sound like a saw but i want the saw not to be like punchy you know let's say i want this to just be punching and the saw comes in then i can do it this way okay we'll talk about what all of this is by the way in the envelope section but for now just know you can do this usually i won't override it though unless it's needed for sound the same purposes okay from there we have our velocity tracking here so this is the this velocity track the sensitivity of the velocity key thing to note with velocity too is a lot of the times it will control the volume so notice if i hit very soft now the volume goes down from here we have the rand and it's just the starting point of this do you want to randomize it you know is it always going to start at the beginning here i'm playing this but you can see that it's not starting as fast but here we let it be from there we have timbre which is gonna change the order that the notes are played so for example right now let's say i'm playing at c3 while i'm playing i'm using the top notes the right notes that steve dudo programmed in that sfc file but if i use timbre and i go higher up you can see i start to use these lower samples to get a brighter response but at the same time this sounds a little bit you know unnatural right so the way you use this is again you can definitely brighten the sample because what this is doing is it's grabbing the slow ones the low samples and speeding them up and usually when you speed up really low pitch samples which increases the way they sound the frequency they tend to sound a lot more unnatural just keep that in mind because one of the strengths of multi-sample is that you don't have to sound unnatural because you're recording the samples at different octave ranges yeah from there we also have a unison for this which is going to stack these sounds so usually i'll use this to make a guitar sound like it has a chorus for example sound like nirvana but the other key thing here is like if i hit this you're going to see that i can also play with the width you the ramp face the range like before we can stack like before we can change the way it works like before we can have the warp change here so if we add a filter we can have some of these sounds so the sample will only use one so usually i'm using a sample if i want to sample or grab a sample and play it through serum so for example another thing that i like to do for these i'll do the more old school route for instance i'm working on minimal nights volume 3 at the moment for you guys so i've been creating stabs with these guys mainly this guy here the ob6 okay the thing is i only have one sample right so the problem with samples like this compared to the multi-sample is that it's only one so if i play really high sounds weird and you can see that the sample plays a lot quicker versus lower plays a lot slower so as you do this it sounds like a playstation startup man what the hell hire me sony there are a few more settings with the sample that we can use and there's a couple more ways to mangle the sound okay so the first thing we have here is a start so we can choose where we start the sample at sometimes this is useful because the beginning part right doesn't sound as good or smooth as these parts okay the next thing is we have the so if i'm not looping the sample low here we have the loop modes all right so one shot mode just play it boom done and we have the forward loop where we can set a loop now here sounds really cool play the sound and it reaches and it just keeps looping forward also have a reverse loop and then just reverses and just keep reversing i also have it going forward and reverse and this side this blue circle do a lot of cool stuff with that look at that then we have the tailed this one's interesting because it reaches the end and then it reverses and just stays at the end and then it's gonna go back and forward and then it's just gonna slowly get quiet over time there it goes there it goes below that we have stuff that will affect the loop okay so for instance we have relative loop so if i choose to go with a forward reverse loop relative loop it's going to make it so that the loop moves with the start point from there we have the link loop length so for this i'm going to right click and i'm going to show marker animation so as i move this see that the loop stays the same okay if i have that off leave you can see i can automate that move it and stays the same then we have exit loop on release play something let's have release boom let go it's going to continue down this journey one more time boom we're in there let go of the note and it gets out of the loop and they become useful because for instance the relative loop and the link loop length if i'm ever modulating this guy here stays the same versus if i have this off look at that that's weird okay so here we go stays the same from there i can also right click here and i can snap to zero snap to beat snap to loop this is all going to have to deal with as i'm moving this guy snaps boom to the beat snaps to zero i think i have to have a loop for this one just right click on the sample and normalize it so if the sample isn't at max amplitude you increase the volume of the sample until the peaks hit the top reverse the audio sample okay trim it for instance if i do this i'm going to trim bam get out of here then we have slicing auto and manual so now if i play a key each key it's going to pertain to a section of the sample so here i'm playing let's say c1 starting here let's get rid of this similar to ableton's lamp or slice mode i can also set manual control on the slices make some of the shots be longer i can input new ones by holding option and clicking for instance here i want to get rid of some option click option click so that way i have bigger gaps then we have some options here play slice to end if i play a slice right we've hit it and instead of it ending it's going to continue towards the end of the sample set the root note so for instance we can have it be higher up sometimes when we slice stuff up you know like c0 to c2 is usually the range for many of them but here we can change that so that when we play c3 we play here c sharp instead of having it be starting at c1 c2 you can also right click and send to the selected clip which will put it here in one of these clips similar to ableton when you have something get sliced or put it into a sampler it's going to play the loop its entirety send to selected clip boom boom if i remember we can activate play single slice and you can like play it during pitch but now how do you switch between the different slices well just gotta move this guy have this set like in a macro which will tell it to move we can go oscillator a and we can modulate slice play mode or the single slice set that range i'm i know we're hitting it but it's just one of the features that this thing has now we click on the scan scan is the rate at which the sample is played so usually like we've talked about before frequency is dependent on the the speed of a sample so we can increase the speed and we can decrease it if we go below zero we reverse it we can also right click and reverse it so that way it's almost the inverse now it's like someone's moving vinyl lock scan rate to tempo if the tempo is increased so will the sample be the scan this is off and i do it again it doesn't do that so you can lock it to the tempo if needed now we have sample like to bpm which pretty much select the length of the sample based on the bpm so now we have a bar one half one fourth demonic Now, in sample mode we are going to have some differences when it comes to the unison mode. For example, here I can add unison, stack the sound, but if I click this here, you're going to see that I can alter the starting point of each, instead of having them all start together, they can each start at different positions of the sample, each of the voices as I detune. Okay, so that's going to be unique to just the sample, instead of like the multi-sample doesn't let you do that. We can stack, we're going to have, again, the different modes we discussed already. We're going to have the span, where in the sample are we starting, so you're localizing a center point on the sample for the phase, for the timing of where everything starts. We're using a combination with this ahead. One key thing to note here is also with the forward reverse loop, if we ever wanted to do this, you can hear how this is kind of a little too sudden, so now I can use this here to apply a crossfade, to just make it sound a lot smoother. Before, in here there's this... Now, smoother. It's good for that. It gets into the loop and you can't even tell, which is super cool for that. Right click, normalize this one, make it a little louder. Keep in mind, you can also use some of the warps, like the filter and distortion on this, but as you distort it, you're not going to see what's happening to the waveform, and then we'll discuss these bottom ones once we get to them in a future episode. All right, cool, so we've gone over most of the stuff with the sample and the multi-sample, so now let's make some sounds with them. So, one of the things I sometimes like to do for these packs is combine organic sounds with inorganic sounds. For example, I'm going to go with a multi-sample and create a bass by using the tone of a real bass guitar. Now the reason that I might choose to do this, let's say I like the tone of this here, but it doesn't have enough low end, and I don't want to play here, right, it sounds too deep. All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to C3 and turn on my keyboard, I'll lower it on the octave to where I like the tone. Okay, from there I'm going to use oscillator B, and I'm going to use one of the basic shapes, either a sine or triangle, lower the octave, minus three, to beef it up, and use as a bass for a house track. Okay, so this is one way of using a combination of the wavetable with the multi-sample. Obviously with multi-sample you can just use any of these as you please, for example, we can have the piano, say I'm playing chords, maybe play with this if we need to, but it doesn't seem like we need to, detune, get the piano sounding western now. The way we play it though is very important, the velocity track. Trying to see if I can change the starting point. Okay, it doesn't seem like it, so we're going to use a wavetable, go digital probably over the analog ones for now, and this is something that will add some nice... I'm going to add some reverb from Ableton, I'm not cheating there, it's needed. So here I can have the grand piano, the baby grand, and a wavetable playing together, let's find a better one. Okay, I can also use the filters now, remove some of those, have this sound be more up top. Okay, I'm going to use this quick little hack in Ableton to create expressive chords just to play some really dope chords. Let's also add some low pass here too. There's more in the back. Those are a little too fancy for me, 7. There we go. So now, we combine the piano with a nice saw. Alright, we use these here. Let's see if we can tune into the piano. One unison, see how that sounds. It sounds great. Alright, we have a bit of reverb and delay, but it sounds really good. Another great sound I think are the marimbas, a lot of people in reggaeton use that, the mallets, those are really cool. We can try this. I'm going to put this at 15, a little bit unison. Let's randomize a bit. Okay, now we can add what I like is the FM ones. Back in the day we would make these botanical sounds. Add a bit of wavetable, a little of this. And now, again, we use the shit out of this filter, don't we? High pass. I wonder if one of these will help. Nope. Going to add that little flavor. The marimbas are nice, I wouldn't really do a lot with them, but let's say that you wanted to keep things organic, and you don't want to spend $200 on UV stuff and go grab another sound, like maybe a piano layer with the marimba. Lord have mercy. So usually when I'm layering sounds, you know, I'm trying to fill in something that might be missing from the other one, which, honestly, a marimba doesn't really need anything. But if I wanted more high frequencies on it, and I still want to play it at that range, I could either one, you know, increase the voicing, right, or I could have another sound that can provide the high frequencies like here. Now here, just to get creative, in fact, maybe I'll go, okay, I'm going to go sample instead so I can loop the piano and get like a really nice reverse. So I'm going to go piano. By the way, this is just thinking on the spot. When you know your tools and you get comfortable, and you know everything you can do, right, it helps to kind of be able to do that. You go like, I want to do something like this. Now you can do it. You don't have to figure it out. Then you can stay in flow, move fast. So I'm going to do this. Unison, I think it sounds delicious. It needs to be louder. And lower now. Now this can be here. Let's put some delay. Ableton won that serum. And now let's add a unison stack sound with a seventh in there for fun. I don't know if it's going to sound good, but you won't know unless you try. Okay, mono the crap out of it here. My word, my word, my word. I'm going to use the filter now to remove this. Now we have this. Okay, that's fucking sexy. Let's increase the start here. So it starts at different spots. This is how Steve intended it. So they're all starting at a different position. Now we get a little bit more beauty there. Okay, cool. All right, guys. So someone knocked on my door, which means I got to go eat. So sadly, our time has come to an end. So by now, you should know how to use the wavetable oscillator. Sample in the multi-sample. As you saw, we can create very beautiful sounds with just that stuff alone. I did cheat a little bit and use the Ableton reverb and delay. But, you know, what life's worth living without reverb and delay. Make sounds with just those elements you have there. If you want, you can follow the sounds I'm making, and hopefully that will lead you down your own path of discovery. Follow along if you want on the sound design session. Make it your own. You know, maybe you hear something else. Maybe you think, oh, the piano idea was cool, but fucking string. Or maybe the vocal one would have been sicker, right? So try out stuff. Play with the tools. That's how you're going to cement your knowledge. And I'll catch you guys tomorrow again for another Complete Guide to Master Serum. This has been episode two. If you guys want to support the channel, you can head over to evilsounds.com. You can find all my sound design work. You guys take care, and you guys have a great rest of your day.",
