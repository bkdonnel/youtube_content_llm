================================================================================

[00:00] Yo what's up ninjas, my name is Sam World and welcome to the Complete Guide to Master

[00:04] Serum 2.

[00:05] In today's episode we're hitting the granular and spectral section of Serum 2 which are

[00:10] going to be the most CPU intensive sections of Serum 2 and it's going to be the section

[00:15] which you can say you can break new sonic boundaries, create atmospheres, create glitch

[00:20] like effects, create cool tech house effects, dubstep wubs, you name it.

[00:24] It's all going to be done here.

[00:25] So let's get into it guys.

[00:27] So the granular section, I have a vocal already inputted because I think with a vocal that

[00:31] is saying multiple things, it's the best way to teach granular because then you start to

[00:36] understand how it works and how you can use it.

[00:38] So right now I have this vocal sample which I have, you know I'm going to play right now

[00:43] and this is going to play from left to right.

[00:44] Take your medicine honey and put your house in order.

[00:48] I said take your medicine honey and put your house in order.

[00:51] And you can see how each green bar is moving as I go from the left to the right.

[00:55] Now with granular what you're doing is you're splitting up any sound source into grains

[01:00] and each grain is going to last a certain length and with this length here you're going

[01:04] to control how many, how long that grain is and also how many right because if you have

[01:09] a short length you're going to have a lot of grains.

[01:11] If you have like a two second length and you have four seconds of a sample you're going

[01:14] to have only two grains because each grain lasts two seconds or divided by two right.

[01:19] So with the length we can control the length of each grain.

[01:22] And watch if I put this down you're going to see the green, now there's more.

[01:26] At higher lengths, here we only have one.

[01:29] Take your medicine honey and put your house in order.

[01:31] I said take your.

[01:32] So we're using it as a sampler right like a sample just playing from left to right.

[01:38] However what starts to change is once we start to move this density, this density decides

[01:42] how many grains we're playing at the same time.

[01:45] So right now we only have one which is why it sounds normal.

[01:48] Now what happens if I put 20.

[01:50] Take your medicine honey and put your house in order.

[01:54] I said take your.

[01:55] So it gets louder right because they're all starting at the same time, they're all playing

[01:59] at the same pitch, nothing's really happening so now we have 20 grains playing at the same

[02:03] time.

[02:05] However what if I start to randomize the length of each grain and randomize the pitch of each

[02:14] grain.

[02:14] We'll do it by one semitone here.

[02:16] Take your medicine honey and put your house in order.

[02:20] I said take your medicine honey.

[02:22] You can hear how now we're starting to get this change of like almost like a chorus effect.

[02:27] But what if I randomize the pan, the left and right of each grain.

[02:32] Take your medicine.

[02:34] Take your medicine honey and put your house in order.

[02:37] I said take your medicine honey and put your house in order.

[02:42] Now what if I randomize the starting point, the scan and the starting point here.

[02:48] Take your medicine honey.

[02:49] I'm going to go crazy as you can hear it and let's lower the grain size a bit so you can

[02:53] hear what's going on.

[02:54] Take your medicine honey and put your house in order.

[03:04] It's jumping all over the place right.

[03:06] Certain grains are playing at the end, certain grains are playing at the beginning, certain

[03:10] ones are following the marker right.

[03:12] And that's what granular does.

[03:14] It modulates the timing of the sample of when we're playing and it does that by chopping

[03:19] it into grains and with those grains we can modulate when each one starts, where, if it's

[03:24] pan left or right.

[03:25] We can randomize that.

[03:26] We can randomize the volume of each one.

[03:28] We can randomize the pitch of each one.

[03:30] We can randomize the direction of each one.

[03:32] Is it going straight?

[03:33] Is it reversing?

[03:35] Okay.

[03:35] And we can automate the offset on each one as well.

[03:37] So that way, if it once intended to start a certain spot, it will offset a little bit

[03:41] each time differently.

[03:42] All right.

[03:43] Now we have this.

[03:43] Let's say I play really high up.

[03:46] I'm going to randomize this pan and now we get the glitch effect we were talking about.

[03:51] Now I'm going to reverse this forward and back.

[03:55] I'm going to increase, decrease the length.

[03:59] I'm going to have more.

[04:00] The density's up.

[04:01] So now we have more grains.

[04:07] Okay.

[04:09] Now when we have grains, they're going to be essentially cross fading between each other.

[04:14] So now we click this blue here.

[04:15] This is where you can control how it does it.

[04:17] Okay.

[04:18] So the amount is how much of whatever shape we add, which is like a volume.

[04:23] Think of it like this is going to alter the volume.

[04:26] It's going to affect.

[04:27] So if I do this, this is giving us more of a slow increase of the volume than a decrease

[04:32] of the grain.

[04:33] So if I increase the length, I'm going to lower a lot of this stuff down, play lower.

[04:39] You can see that when I play something, it slowly comes in and put your house in order.

[04:45] I said, take your medicine, honey, and put you lower the length a bit more, put the grain

[04:50] at around.

[04:53] All right.

[04:53] So right now we only have one green plane, so you're hearing the change between each

[04:57] grain.

[04:57] Remember the grains are created by the granular splitting each section up into a little pocket.

[05:03] And as we go between each pocket, this is going to switch and this is going to decide

[05:09] how we blend.

[05:10] So we're going to have multiple different ones.

[05:12] We can see it to the left.

[05:14] So it's more of a, or more of a reverse.

[05:18] We can also randomize each value here with this randomize over this.

[05:24] Now we have this.

[05:29] Let's decrease the scan rate a bit.

[05:31] Now if I put a lead, let's put it at a seventh, I'm going to add reverb and delay.

[05:44] You can see how this helps create something that sounds different that you don't really

[05:50] hear too often.

[05:54] Okay.

[05:54] Now we switch it.

[06:04] Then we have the sync, turkey, decrease the length, and this is what makes it so special.

[06:25] So go through them all.

[06:30] We're going to go here.

[06:36] As granular, you have to hear it in order to understand what you can do with it.

[06:43] Right?

[06:43] This sounds crazy.

[06:44] Like if someone asks me to remake this sound, just using a synth, it would be really hard

[06:51] to do it.

[06:54] Here, I'm still holding down these chords I'm playing.

[06:56] Okay.

[06:57] Let's increase the density a bit more.

[06:59] Decrease the length.

[07:00] See how that sounds.

[07:04] Okay.

[07:05] Let's switch the sound source to something that's a little more like a loop.

[07:10] Let's try a non-tonal loop, like a percussion loop and see what happens with that.

[07:16] I'm going to randomize the time and the offset.

[07:21] Now we get this.

[07:24] I'll play really low.

[07:29] I'm going to randomize the pitch.

[07:36] And you can see how you got some going reverse, some going like crazy, right?

[07:43] It's going forward, some playing at a higher pitch, some at a lower.

[07:50] The other thing too, okay, is we can unison each grain and this is what makes it so CPU

[07:56] intensive because the moment I increase this, each grain is getting detuned.

[08:02] So now look at my CPU.

[08:05] So now another thing is when I detune, I have settings with the detunement.

[08:10] I have a blend, which is similar to the blend that we had with the wavetable.

[08:22] We're going to have the detunement here.

[08:26] We have a stack.

[08:33] If I go back to sample, this is what we started with.

[08:39] We detuned and now we go granular again.

[08:46] So we get, all right, so we have the start point.

[08:49] So we can again, randomize the starting point of the grains for each unison that we created.

[08:54] We can also span, which is the starting point again, like essentially override the original

[09:01] starting point, the range of the detunement and the width.

[09:06] Mono it, increase it.

[09:07] And then we have the spawn pattern, which is going to control when each one starts.

[09:11] So they can all start together with even the timing of each grain.

[09:14] Let's say we have six spread out evenly with exponential.

[09:18] It slowly increases every single time one spawns.

[09:20] So for instance, one spawns in a second, the next one is going to spawn in two and

[09:23] then in four and then in eight, and then we can randomly spawn.

[09:28] Have I right click clear on the image.

[09:31] I can select show XY controller, which if I move this, you're going to see this little

[09:35] dot here.

[09:36] So now this dot, you can set it to control the position.

[09:42] But now if you right click again, you can now have the Y axis control something.

[09:48] So for example, I can have it control the volume, the warp, the grain length.

[09:52] So if I go up and down, I can show the length left to right control the position.

[09:57] So for instance, let's say I get a chord loop real quick.

[10:02] So like this, if I go up and show the length.

[10:12] And by right clicking, I can also modulate Y with something.

[10:16] Like for instance, I can add it to a macro, control it.

[10:26] Density again is going to control this guy here.

[10:34] Let's get rid of the length one.

[10:48] I'm slowing down the scan rate.

[10:53] So now if I move this.

[11:05] Let's randomize the pan.

[11:18] Unison.

[11:21] That's the tune last.

[11:41] We can BPM sync a lot of this stuff.

[11:43] So that way we can just create grains based on the time signature.

[11:46] So every one fourth, there's a grain, which puts it in a, let's see, let's remove this.

[11:52] Yeah, yeah, we got it.

[11:55] But a lead, I'm going to grab the loop here.

[11:57] I'm going to do this and I'm going to try and see if I can trim it.

[12:01] So now we have this trim.

[12:05] Boom.

[12:06] So now I have this little reverb portion of the piano.

[12:09] I can right click and normalize it.

[12:15] Now we have this.

[12:19] So we can sync each one on fourth density.

[12:33] Playing lower.

[12:40] A little off, but that's fine.

[12:46] Dot it.

[12:48] Put the dotted there.

[12:53] Let's make the density lower.

[13:00] I want it to more stutter.

[13:01] So I'm a lower this length.

[13:06] Now I can crossfade between like the sampler here.

[13:14] We have this beautiful sound.

[13:21] Okay.

[13:22] So now wintering the spectral section, right?

[13:27] We're going from time, which green was all about the time.

[13:29] As you saw, we were able to manipulate time in a way where it created very interesting stuff.

[13:33] Now it's spectral.

[13:36] We're manipulating the frequency itself, not the shape of a wave because the wave table

[13:41] has to deal with changing the shape of the saw, right?

[13:44] We can use the warps like a band plus and all that good stuff to shape the sound differently,

[13:50] which and then results in the sound sounding different with spectral.

[13:53] We're using samples.

[13:54] Then we are manipulating the harmonics, the frequencies of it.

[13:57] Whenever I say harmonics, partial, all that means is when I have a sine wave here,

[14:03] I'm playing the first partial that of the note that I'm on because each note like a B,

[14:09] a one, a zero, depending on the octave is going to be related to a certain frequency.

[14:13] So that note, the first mountain you see will be what we call the fundamental.

[14:17] So with the sign, we only have one partial fundamental.

[14:20] From there, we get the overtones, which usually you'll see with a triangle.

[14:24] You'll start to see them.

[14:25] So we go basic shapes, put a triangle.

[14:28] All these new additions here is what we would call partials as well.

[14:33] Okay, so then we're going to have harmonic partials,

[14:35] which are going to be multiples of this guy here.

[14:38] So they're going to be harmonically related.

[14:40] They're going to be multiplied by two, three, four.

[14:43] What spectral synthesis is doing, it's messing with the harmonics of the sound,

[14:49] the frequency of a sound.

[14:50] Okay, so here I have this basic deep stab.

[14:54] First off, start of the sample, end of the sample.

[14:58] I can zoom in, right?

[15:00] The more green it is, the more frequency,

[15:03] harmonic content there is at that specific frequency.

[15:06] From the bottom, we go low frequencies to the top, it's high.

[15:10] To the right here, I can use this to almost like a filter to cut out certain parts.

[15:19] Why is this useful?

[15:19] Well, let's say I have this sound and I want to, let's say,

[15:23] have a stable tone on the sign or that bottom one,

[15:26] then I can use a sign, which is just that one fundamental.

[15:33] Okay, so that's one use for that.

[15:36] I can also, let's say I have a web sound or something,

[15:40] and I want to like add like an interesting texture to it.

[15:43] Well, I can play it by holding A, do the web.

[15:49] Now I can grab that here, bring it here, bring it back in here.

[15:52] Now I have it here.

[15:56] So now this becomes the interesting texture.

[16:01] Now I can grab maybe just the top part, detune it a bit.

[16:11] You know, assuming that's the same thing, I'm just going to do this.

[16:16] Okay, we have that.

[16:17] I'm going to bring that in.

[16:22] So that's what this would be for.

[16:24] But now the other thing, let's say I have a dubstep growl like this, right?

[16:29] A lot of opportunities present themselves now, okay?

[16:33] For example, I can loop like before.

[16:37] We're not really going to dive into this because we already know what it does.

[16:39] It's going to be very similar to the sampler and simpler.

[16:41] But the new thing we get is this cut, this filter where we can alter

[16:49] the frequencies, the harmonics of the sound,

[16:53] and move to create these nasty-ass fucking things.

[16:59] So now I'm going to normalize.

[17:13] So I can alter the harmonic range here.

[17:15] And there's going to be some presets that you can use.

[17:18] As you can see, my remap's here too.

[17:23] You can alter that.

[17:24] And there's also the presets that we can use here.

[17:31] You can also click here and put a wavetable, which you're going to see,

[17:36] which is very interesting.

[17:37] I don't know how I would use that, but

[17:40] just found out what you guys.

[17:43] Now at the bottom here in the warp, we are going to have new features.

[17:47] We're going to have a spectral section now.

[17:49] And all this is going to do is it's a way it's going to mess with the harmonics,

[17:52] the frequencies of this guy up here.

[17:55] So I'm going to switch to a more basic sound.

[17:59] Here's going to smear the harmonics or the transients of a sound.

[18:02] So if you have a drum or something, and it's going to make it sound a little bit more blurry.

[18:10] And then we have spread plus or minus,

[18:13] which is going to spread the harmonics across the frequency spectrum.

[18:19] So, you know, sound design for video games, movies,

[18:23] maybe if you wanted to create a very gnarly uplifter.

[18:29] The next one is harmonics, adding more harmonics to what we already have.

[18:39] You can also add sub harmonics.

[18:44] She's going to add harmonics below the ones you have.

[18:47] So think of it as almost like a sub oscillator.

[18:48] You're going to be beefing up the sound more.

[18:54] Next one we have is a gate.

[18:55] So it's going to act like a gate, but on the frequency itself.

[18:58] So certain frequencies are going to be louder than others when you have a sound,

[19:01] right, depending on how the sound sounds.

[19:03] So with the gate, as we go from the bottom up,

[19:05] you're getting out the quieter ones and leaving only the loud ones.

[19:11] In this instance would be the bass, because it's a bass sound.

[19:17] Robotize is going to add robotic qualities to the sound,

[19:19] usually through pitch correction or modulation.

[19:26] Shift is just going to change the frequency content of the sound.

[19:29] So it sounds like a shift.

[19:35] Mirror is going to start to mirror the frequency spectrum.

[19:39] We're just adding too many harmonics that we already have, just inverting.

[19:42] Peak follow will adjust the frequencies based on the peak amplitude of the signal.

[19:47] So you can see that we remove some of the high end out of there.

[19:51] And when we go down, remove some of it, almost like a filter.

[19:55] Peak octave 12 or minus 12 will change the peak frequency up or down an octave.

[19:59] So...

[20:00] So 12 is 12.

[20:03] Minus 12.

[20:07] Good for tear out dubstep.

[20:13] Peak harmonics minus 12 and 12 just shifts the harmonic content up or down an octave.

[20:22] As you can see all of them being shifted up.

[20:24] Minus 12.

[20:27] So if I play down one octave right now you can hear and put this up but that's all that's

[20:34] doing so it's doing it to the harmonics which spectral has to deal with again the harmonics

[20:38] of the sound so we're just manipulating the frequency.

[20:44] Harm sweep kind of like a filter sweep except with the harmonics.

[20:50] Shepherd's gonna create a shepherd's tone which is just an illusion like the sound is

[20:53] going to keep going up and up and up so as we go from left to right it's going to keep

[20:59] going up.

[21:04] Shepherd W is a variation of that sounds like we have a lot more like of a detuned shepherd's

[21:12] tone with it.

[21:12] By the way these are not even in the manual which is making it a little hard to explain

[21:16] for you guys so I'm trying my best with it.

[21:18] The comb filter is going to add a comb filter to the harmonics of the sound.

[21:23] Similar to like a comb filter you're going to find in Serum 2 which is usually going

[21:27] to be a filter we hatch a lot of peaks and valleys which creates phase alterations to

[21:31] the sound and also changes the tonality of it usually making it sound a lot more interesting

[21:35] in exchange for fatness and in exchange for forward presence of a pitch blend which to

[21:41] be fair I don't know what it's doing.

[21:47] Pitch shift.

[21:59] Pitch shift shifts the pitch up or down all the harmonics just get moved up and down.

[22:07] Phase switch alters the phase of the harmonics sometimes leading to phase cancellation or

[22:10] phase enhancement.

[22:12] Switch the sound.

[22:17] We have a formant which is applying a formant like quality to the harmonic sound which usually

[22:22] formants are going to look like this.

[22:24] Very extreme filters to kind of produce a vocal quality like an A and an OY to the sound.

[22:35] Then we have mask which you're going to need something in Sound Source B or C to use.

[22:39] The idea of it is that you're going to mask some of the signal to allow this one to pop

[22:44] out more.

[22:45] So right now if I mask this sound you can see that it sounds like it's getting spectrally

[22:50] ducked based on whatever sound we put here so if I put this there.

[22:56] Let's pick another one.

[23:02] Then we have a vocoder effect.

[23:15] Still don't have a use for that.

[23:20] So let's do a little quick sound design sesh with the new stuff we did already with the

[23:24] granular like a couple of cool little sounds how we would incorporate stuff.

[23:27] But for now let's see what we can do here.

[23:32] So let's start off with the spectral since we already made a lot of sounds with the granular.

[23:36] I'm going to use a stab.

[23:38] I'm going to let's say go with maybe the spectral one of these guys and use what its strengths

[23:44] are.

[23:44] I really liked how some of these sounded like the subharmonic so add some subharmonic content.

[23:59] Now I'm going to put an oscillator like a Reese we're going to use a filter low pass

[24:06] filter eventually we'll access the filter section next time.

[24:10] But for now we just have to use these here.

[24:14] Let's fine tune here.

[24:18] I'm going to use the warp like that.

[24:24] See if we can use another spectral effect.

[24:27] Let's try the spread.

[24:32] Let's use a filter now to cut out some of the lows.

[24:36] Now you do it like this.

[24:39] So now we have this really haunting effect.

[24:44] Let's see if I can normalize it.

[24:45] Right click normalize.

[24:48] Just to the left here real quick.

[24:53] I'm going to lower the volume down of the sauce like that.

[25:00] It's pretty sick.

[25:08] There we go.

[25:09] Some unison.

[25:11] We have here the unison effects for it similar to all the others.

[25:14] Let's see if we can stack by three.

[25:35] Anything interesting here?

[25:40] Let's use the noise section now to create a nice texture to the sides.

[25:46] Maybe something that's more like a kick.

[25:51] Looping that low pitch.

[26:02] That's kind of scary isn't it?

[26:11] Switch the samples.

[26:13] Anything else comes in?

[26:18] That's cool.

[26:21] Two.

[26:23] Seven.

[26:30] Now we can EQ the highs out a bit to keep it here.

[26:35] Alright.

[26:36] Let's get that 3D effect on the sound by respecting the space and widening this.

[26:50] Trying to see if there's anything else.

[26:52] Maybe lower the scan rate to play it very low.

[27:09] There we go.

[27:17] Cool.

[27:19] And there you go.

[27:21] That's even crazier isn't it?

[27:26] So cool.

[27:27] Let's initialize the sound.

[27:28] So we need something somatic.

[27:29] Anyways guys I'm in a hurry today because my wife knocked on the door like ten minutes ago.

[27:33] So that means I have to get going.

[27:34] But hopefully this video helps you guys out.

[27:36] Towards the end of the video we're going to do sound design sessions and we're going to target more of the spectral.

[27:40] Serum 2 is not letting me import stuff as I usually would.

[27:43] Because usually what I'll do is make a sound and then import it and use spectral to give it that interesting flavor as you guys saw.

[27:48] But with that being said I'll catch you guys next time for another video.

[27:50] Hopefully you guys are having fun learning Serum 2 with me.

[27:53] And again if you guys want to support the channel you can head over to evilsounds.com where you can find all of my sound design work.

[27:58] You guys take care and you guys have a great rest of your day.
