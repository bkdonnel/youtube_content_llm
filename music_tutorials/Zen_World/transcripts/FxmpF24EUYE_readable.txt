================================================================================

[00:00] Alright ninjas, welcome to the complete guide to Master Serum 2.

[00:04] If you're still here with me, I want to give you a hug because you're killing it.

[00:08] You're going through it all and I'm very proud of you.

[00:11] You're going to notice here at the bottom left of Ableton, we can change the velocity.

[00:14] When you're inputting MIDI, you will also be able to play with the velocity.

[00:17] And if you're playing on a MIDI keyboard, the harder you press a note, the higher the

[00:21] velocity value and the softer you play, the lower the velocity value.

[00:25] Velocity is going to change a knob depending on how hard or how high the value is or how

[00:29] low.

[00:30] Okay, so some good examples of where you might set your velocity, and we're going to go into

[00:34] the matrix here real quick, is routing it to your amp.

[00:37] Now at the top right of this matrix, you can see there's this little arrow we can click

[00:40] and there by default is create fellow amp assignment.

[00:43] So if you click that, you're going to notice, okay, now we have this and you can see here

[00:46] the amount, the range of how much it's going to alter the volume.

[00:51] And you can see how velocity, and you can also see where it's at here, it's affecting the

[00:57] volume of the sound.

[00:57] So now if I programmed a velocity parameter in a patch, it wouldn't be this drastic.

[01:03] I would actually have it a lot more lower just to have a sense of movement in the sound,

[01:09] right?

[01:10] But also velocity can be applied to multiple other things.

[01:13] Just to give you a couple of ideas, the filter cutoff is another really cool one that we

[01:17] can add velocity to.

[01:18] I'm going to put a high one, low, so as you're playing a sound, you can increase the velocity.

[01:27] If we grab an envelope like so, we can also do this, or we're opening like so, and now

[01:40] higher velocity opens up more and it opens up more.

[01:45] Now with this graph, what you're going to be able to do is create your own custom curves.

[01:49] So that way the velocity reacts the way you want it.

[01:51] It's scaled differently here.

[01:52] So by default, you know, this is very gradual.

[01:54] I think the term for that would be considered linear.

[01:57] The way I like to use it personally is, you know, for instance, acid type sounds in Serum

[02:01] 2, if I wanted to mimic like an accent, I might go for a squared look.

[02:05] So that way below a certain value, this is very low, above a certain value, you get like

[02:11] a full openness of the sound and it doesn't have to be that drastic.

[02:13] It could be simple like, and this velocity can be routed to multiple things, like for

[02:18] instance, a decay, whatever your heart desires.

[02:20] But here I would do it to the decay because watch, I'm going to do this.

[02:29] OK, and I can create that movement like so, I believe.

[02:32] Yeah, you right click here, legato portamento time, you have the portamento to be applied

[02:37] to the velocity curve when a note is triggered and another is already held.

[02:41] So we'll get that into a sec.

[02:42] But at the bottom here, we have our voicing section.

[02:44] So I'm going to set up a mono legato and bring this up.

[02:46] So now I'm increasing my velocity here.

[02:59] Lastly, we can also right click to access the initialization of a grab.

[03:02] Let's say you do something, you can initialize it.

[03:05] Let's say you like the curve of one preset.

[03:07] You can lock the module.

[03:09] So that way, as you move through presets, the velocity module you've set stays from

[03:15] there. You can also have legato portamento time, which, according to the manual, is in

[03:21] the context where you have portamento applied to the velocity curve when a note is

[03:24] triggered and another is already held under to the right.

[03:27] We have a note and this note.

[03:29] The way I like to think about it is like the key track feature we used in the filter

[03:33] section, the higher you play, the higher the value, the more change you're going to get

[03:36] and the lower you play, the lower the change will be.

[03:40] So, for example, if I play my note to the level and I play low, you can see here the

[03:44] notes down there and you can see it here as I go up.

[03:48] What might that be useful for?

[03:51] Well, a lot of times it just depends for me.

[03:53] Like if there's a certain sound where I feel like the producer using it might go up on

[03:57] it, I want to definitely change some values.

[03:59] And again, for that one, I might also play with the curve in order to optimize for the

[04:03] producer to have success using the sound.

[04:05] In this scenario, if you're making sounds for your music, you might be like wanting

[04:08] something to happen as you play higher up and you will use this to move the knob that

[04:13] will allow that idea in your head to be heard through the sound as you move from a

[04:17] bottom note to a high note.

[04:19] Right. So we already know, again, the filter will have that by default.

[04:23] But if you ever wanted your own like, like curve to it, like for instance, like this

[04:29] where you're playing the bass and then when you go above a certain note, just opens up

[04:37] a lot, then you can set it up like that.

[04:40] OK. OK, and from there, I believe, again, same parameters as your Velo here.

[04:44] You can also have legato and knit it and lock it as well.

[04:47] Below that, we have the voicing section of Serum and this section.

[04:52] I like to pay a lot of attention to it.

[04:55] The main reason is that, you know, a lot of synths, analog synths, and I keep going back

[05:00] to them, but it's because I learned a lot from them and the limitations they said just

[05:04] kind of taught me, OK, there's certain reasons why certain synths sound a certain way.

[05:08] First off, here we have the poly count.

[05:10] Right. So what this means is that depending on how many voices you have, this is how

[05:14] many notes are allowed to play.

[05:16] So, for example, let's say I have a long release sound and I have my poly set to 25

[05:19] and I just play a bunch of notes right now.

[05:21] Like I'm just going to.

[05:24] Let's put it to the right one.

[05:31] I'll lower the volume.

[05:34] Here I have 20 playing right now, and as the release fades on each voice, it's

[05:38] eventually going to start going down in value.

[05:41] However, let's say I'm making a sound like this and I want to limit the amount of

[05:43] voices, because as you heard, it can get really hectic and I can set two.

[05:49] And I don't get the effect anymore because there's only two voices being allowed.

[05:54] So I'm only allowed to play two notes at a time.

[05:56] If I increase that polyphony to around eight voices.

[06:05] As I play this, right, I'm borrowing notes, so I'm cancelling out some of the notes.

[06:11] They don't even go through the end of the release, which leads to a sound that's

[06:14] more not as lush and as full as some people might say, but at higher values.

[06:20] You can get that full lushness if that's what you want, or you can see it in the way

[06:24] that I can limit that so that way I don't get too much.

[06:26] OK, I had from there to the left, we have a mono, which will just make it one voice.

[06:32] Right. So again, you can still have multiple voices inside a

[06:37] sound, but you can only have one.

[06:39] Now for the legato, what this does is let's say that I make like a really nice

[06:43] saw bass right now that envelopes triggering.

[06:46] Now, if I glide my notes,

[06:49] I'm getting a portamento, but also I want you to notice how that envelope is still

[06:53] triggering. If I set legato,

[06:57] when I glide my notes, the envelope doesn't retrigger anymore.

[07:00] So that's what legato does.

[07:03] From there, the portamento time works for mono legato.

[07:05] And what this is doing is as I overlap notes,

[07:09] it's controlling how long it takes for me to go from one note

[07:14] to the note that I'm gliding to.

[07:17] So at high values, you can sound kind of cool like that.

[07:21] But then we have this always knob, which makes it so that I'm playing.

[07:26] It will always get that portamento, that change.

[07:32] Really cool for dirty Dutch leads, I would say, or you wanted to do that pitbull

[07:36] lead I did.

[07:42] It's you're going to do it with the always on.

[07:44] There we have the scale, which is just going to make the portamento time slower

[07:48] on how far.

[07:51] 

[07:54] Slow.

[07:57] And below that, we have the curve, this is going to just control how the

[08:00] portamento is applied, usually if I'm doing something like acid sounds and I

[08:04] want to mimic a three or three, this is where I might play with this or if I'm

[08:07] gliding between notes.

[08:10] And I don't like the way it sounds and I can play with the curvature of it.

[08:16] You can see that one.

[08:19] Right. Versus in the middle.

[08:25] Limit same note to Polly, the one you can voice deal, which again, the voice

[08:29] deal thing is, remember when we have, let's say, like release

[08:33] and we're just like playing the.

[08:41] You can decide where is it feeling, is it the newest note, the oldest

[08:45] note, the highest note, the lowest note, the velocity.

[08:48] So, for instance, if I wanted to keep, let's say, the lowest note, I can

[08:50] choose to make the low ones a priority.

[08:55] The low one stays there no matter what, until it fades out.

[08:58] That's the idea of that.

[09:00] And OK, so we've covered these two from there to the left.

[09:02] We have macros here.

[09:03] Now, macros are pretty much knobs

[09:07] that aren't doing anything until you assign it and you can assign it to

[09:11] multiple knobs, similar to LFOs and envelopes.

[09:13] But the difference is with this, you control it with this knob from the left

[09:16] to the right. And these can also be bipolar or unipolar.

[09:18] For instance, let's say I have here, like.

[09:22] Let's say I want to make an uplifter, right, so I can route that to the pitch.

[09:27] I can create an EQ, I can route this to the frequency,

[09:31] I can increase the quality on it a bit like so.

[09:37] And then, yeah, like that, I want to cut, there we go.

[09:41] I want to add some reverb.

[09:42] Let's use one of those gnarly ones we talked about last time.

[09:51] All right, let's go higher up, put it in front.

[10:03] And you put it all on this one knob, and then all you have to do now

[10:06] is just modulate this one knob through your DAW.

[10:08] I want a vibrato effect, but I don't want it to always be there.

[10:15] Then I can go into the matrix, route a macro here to the aux source.

[10:20] And now when I put the macro up.

[10:28] It will play the vibrato.

[10:30] So now this auxiliary source is going to determine and tell the LFO

[10:34] how much it's allowed to open that up by.

[10:36] OK, so we'll talk about that in a sec.

[10:38] But that's what macros are for.

[10:40] In Serum 2, you're going to have a total of eight.

[10:41] And you can also route macros to macros, like you can say,

[10:45] oh, I want to modulate this and this, and then you can have that as well.

[10:48] OK, from there, if you right click,

[10:51] you can remove all this tenacious and play and delete the macro.

[10:53] It doesn't seem like you can lock it.

[10:55] You can copy and paste it, of course, as well.

[10:57] And I believe you should be able to copy and paste

[11:00] between different presets on macros as well.

[11:02] Bottom part here, we have a mod wheel and we have our pitch bend wheel.

[11:06] Pitch bend wheel.

[11:06] If you have a MIDI keyboard, you know you can move that in order to move it.

[11:10] So usually it's like

[11:13] one thing is to the right.

[11:15] You have your numbers for the bend up.

[11:16] This is going to be your your range.

[11:18] So, for instance, if I'm making an uplifter, I want to use the pitch bend wheel

[11:24] and then

[11:26] other things, cool things to do with it.

[11:27] Let's say you want to pitch up from a fifth, let's say.

[11:32] So you can put the fifth there.

[11:37] OK, so that's how we would use that.

[11:39] It's just the bend range.

[11:40] Really useful for when you're creating certain patches

[11:43] and you want to lead to a certain sound, then you can do it that way as well.

[11:47] OK, from there, we go into the matrix section and the matrix.

[11:52] You know, you're the one by now.

[11:53] This is where you're going to find all your modulations.

[11:56] So I'm actually going to go into one of the presets here from Minimal Nights.

[12:06] In the matrix, I can see all the modulations of this preset,

[12:10] and the way you're going to use this is one you can reorganize your macros like so.

[12:14] It doesn't alter anything.

[12:15] It's just in case you want certain macros on top.

[12:16] You can have them on top here.

[12:18] You can also have the LFO and the envelope section move out the way

[12:22] so that way you can look at your overall macros.

[12:25] I believe you can have a total of 64 inside of Serum 2.

[12:29] OK, and the modulation section is just where you're going to find again,

[12:33] just like what's being routed to what you can deactivated by clicking on this guy.

[12:38] You can delete it by clicking on the X.

[12:40] Here you're going to have your amount for each modulation.

[12:43] So, for example, right now there's this gnarly

[12:46] movement on the on this low pass filter, which is adding the

[12:52] you know, that effect.

[12:55] So I LFO 2, so now if I go matrix,

[12:58] I should be able to find it LFO 2, look for the name LFO 2.

[13:03] It's right here.

[13:03] And you can see it's being routed here to filter one frequency.

[13:06] I can control the amount here.

[13:09] How much is it bipolar, unipolar?

[13:13] This is the destination.

[13:15] From there, we have this out here, which shows you a visual of the modulation.

[13:21] Next, we have the auxiliary sources, which you guys already know how to use.

[13:24] You can route multiple things there.

[13:26] The most popular things I would route there are velocity.

[13:29] For instance, the velocity now controls.

[13:33] I'm going to play a low velocity right now.

[13:36] No change, but as I increase the velocity,

[13:38] you can see that the LFO is not allowed to go higher and higher up.

[13:43] You know, we have max velocity and we get that.

[13:46] Multiple different things you can route stuff to.

[13:48] There is going to be some things that you won't be able to route stuff to.

[13:52] According to the Serum 2 manual.

[13:56] There's three modulations that are only available to set

[13:58] using like through this method, and I'll name a few active voices.

[14:02] Note on all one half, which is between zero and one to each note

[14:05] on the state of note all two.

[14:06] Again, this is all stuff like, am I OK?

[14:09] You can't really add like just by drag and dropping.

[14:12] So those are just a few to name.

[14:13] And again, you can resort to the Serum manual if it's something important

[14:16] that you think you need to know.

[14:18] For me personally, I was OK not knowing that those existed.

[14:21] Polarity again, left, right.

[14:22] We have the amount which we can right click and reset.

[14:24] We can also invert the auxiliary signal.

[14:27] So, for example, if let's say I were to put a let's see on the envelopes,

[14:31] I were to put an auxiliary with a mod.

[14:34] So let's click here to bring that back.

[14:35] It's going to be allowed to work and it's just reversed.

[14:42] Then again, we're inversing it.

[14:51] Similar to what we were doing with the portamento and all that,

[14:53] this curve is going to be more for your auxiliary source

[14:56] on how it's going to react as you bring it in.

[14:59] For example, here we have.

[15:01] As we bring it up,

[15:04] how is it reacting at really high?

[15:06] You can see that the values I don't need to go as high to have it open up

[15:11] versus when I have it all the way down.

[15:14] I got to be a little bit more heavy handed to the right of that.

[15:17] We have the output.

[15:18] It's kind of like the last line of where you might, oh, you know,

[15:22] maybe a little less open on the filter and then you just do it here.

[15:25] And I guess you guys saw already here.

[15:27] We do have this sort by source or by destination.

[15:29] We can lock it so that as we change presets.

[15:32] All right. So we've gone through a lot.

[15:34] So now it's time to make some really dope sounds.

[15:36] So why don't we get into it, guys?

[15:39] So one thing that is going to come to life now is if we create the seven sound

[15:43] we've been creating, I love doing this one.

[15:45] We can make it matter more by putting a velocity on this guy.

[15:50] But usually what I like to do more is I like to use an envelope like so.

[15:54] Open the filter up as usual.

[15:55] I'll put it at max value.

[16:01] And then I'll right click aux source here, so now we can do that.

[16:05] And instead of going into the matrix, I'll just go here, go note velocity like so.

[16:10] And now I can move that.

[16:15] So now I'm going to, let's say, create a cool little pattern with some changes here.

[16:20] So let's just play something.

[16:28] Let's play something.

[16:52] Slower the release.

[16:59] As you can see, too much

[17:02] change. It's a little bad, right? So why don't we go into the matrix,

[17:06] into the auxiliary source here and change the curve.

[17:31] Cue it up a bit.

[17:37] And lower.

[17:47] I'm gonna be clean about it.

[17:57] Put some reverb.

[18:02] Go vintage.

[18:07] Lower the depth. Steve, change that.

[18:13] Okay, cool. We got a dope sound and now macros being added here.

[18:21] Let's play with the velocity. We're gonna have everything low for now.

[18:24] So now we're gonna set the low velocity. I'm gonna set this down like so

[18:28] and maybe have it go straight up here.

[18:32] Okay, and then I'm gonna add an envelope.

[18:37] Okay, high resonance.

[18:42] Now I want to create the accent. So when there's an accent, that means that the velocity is going

[18:46] to go up. Accent is just going to emphasize. So we're going to add it to the cutoff here.

[18:51] So now the high notes, I'm actually going to have them go up. There you go.

[18:57] And then we'll do these.

[19:09] So I'm gonna add mono legato. I'm gonna create the iconic light that the acid sounds have.

[19:15] I'm gonna set a curve. I'm gonna set the curve like this for now.

[19:18] And I'm gonna overlap the notes where I want to create a slide.

[19:23] Like that and then portamento.

[19:31] Like so.

[19:38] There is a change that occurs. Keep that in mind. I am testing that out.

[19:44] The velocity higher up.

[19:47] I'm also going to increase the decay a bit so it stays up longer.

[19:53] Let's add some distortion now.

[20:00] Let's use the pre and remove low end.

[20:08] Let's increase the volume a bit and also add the velocity.

[20:17] Now let's tighten this up more.

[20:27] We can make the sound so much better.

[20:41] Just gotta put in the work.

[20:42] Let's make the decay of it be velocity dependent as well.

[20:58] Let's play with the curve a bit.

[21:04] But now we gotta start a little higher up.

[21:08] That was a bad idea because now there's way too much control.

[21:13] Let's give it a bit.

[21:20] That's in the way.

[21:24] Cue. That's a little shorter.

[21:31] Play around with other parts of the distortion.

[21:43] The delay was cool but it was way too much.

[22:04] It's getting there.

[22:07] Let's see the decay value maybe more.

[22:14] Again, velocity is riding a lot of stuff so let's maybe ease up a bit on it.

[22:44] Let's use the saw shape too because remember the tonality is also very important.

[23:13] Let's try maybe like we got this.

[23:28] Put delay before distortion.

[23:47] I'll play with the velocity.

[23:55] Energy transfer.

[24:03] Click. Here let's get rid of the legato.

[24:13] So now you know what to do with your velocity, your note, your matrix, how to grab presets

[24:18] and add that touch to them so that you can create movement to the sound and make your

[24:22] tracks feel less static.

[24:23] With that being said, you guys take care and if you guys are enjoying the series, make
