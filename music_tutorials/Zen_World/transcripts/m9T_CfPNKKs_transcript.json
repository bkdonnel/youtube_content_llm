    "text": "yo what's up ninjas we've been making some sick sounds but we've been lacking a bit of dynamics and a bit of change well today that's gonna change because we're gonna be learning about envelopes which is gonna allow us to make punchy basses, pads, lush leads and sounds that move that change over time. In Serum 2 envelope 1 is routed to the volume by default and I think volume is one of the best ways to learn the ADSR system that most envelopes are gonna use so my next volume is gonna be decided by the main volume and the levels inside each oscillator they're all gonna be controlled by this envelope 1 so for example at the moment if we increase the attack of the sound the sound will gradually come in and that's because the attack controls the first part of an envelope which is how long it takes for us to reach the max value which with this envelope we can't really move or change okay so that's gonna be decided by wherever everything your levels are set. Something to note here is that I can also play with the slope of this very important because if I want to dial in the sound more and with how I envision it slope is gonna allow us to gradually go in or slowly come up and then all of a sudden get to that desired loudness which can be useful for brassy sounds. To the right of that we have a hold which we're gonna come back to after we go through decay sustain and release. Now decay is gonna control once the attack phase is over we're at the max amplitude decay controls how long it takes for us to go from that max amplitude to our sustain okay and our sustain is the value in this instance the volume what we're gonna stay at as a MIDI note is held after the attack and decay phase have passed and then I move it down volumes coming down I'm still holding the note you can see that here I go up mid but sustain I can lower it down to around let's say 75% of the way down and now decay when we move it you're gonna hear what it does okay so decay controls value coming from that max amplitude to the sustain however decay is also very useful for pretty much I'm adding perceived punch to a sound okay from there we have our release which is gonna control the fade out of the sound after I let go of the note so right now I'm stuck in sustain because I'm holding down the note but once I let go the release kicks in and that release decides how long the sound lingers for before it reaches back to quiet no sound or a value of zero change hold what it's gonna do is it's gonna hold after the attack phase it's gonna hold max amplitude for however much time you set now the way this is useful is let's say that I have a sound or I'm creating a sound for future rave or melodic techno where I want to lead that's gonna be very staccato okay now I can definitely program a lead that's staccato without the hold with a high sustain the problem with that is as a sound designer I've noticed some people need a bit of guidance and I need to make it easy for them to use the sound as intended okay so with the hold I can have it be so that when someone presses the note even for a long time the hold limits that so now play and I make it super punchy now there's a couple of things that we can do here number one we can change the value or the the time right sec milliseconds to 1 8th 1 4th 16th if you like that system a lot better which I can find use for that whenever I'm trying to create an effect let's say I want the effect to come up for a bar and then I want it to go down for two bars which might be useful for something like creating a noise swell and there we go you know goes up a bar and goes down for two bars so that's where it might be useful the other thing too is if you notice here if I increase the decay I cannot see what's happening after that so here I have by pulling up a zoom out feature and by pulling down I zoom in okay and I also have a lock feature which locked itself automatically zoom in for me which is good and bad the reason I say good and bad is because sometimes I'll do this and I'm like yep that that definitely looks like how a pad should be shaped and then I'll play it and the sound doesn't last how it should so that's the only drawback of that so sometimes I just like to zoom out like this and then do this envelope one is routed to the volume so what else can you route envelopes to the most common common common common things that they would add envelopes to are the filter cutoff to create plucks so here I'm going to use envelope 2 and open up the cutoff and lower down the sustain and use the decay to get the punch now let's talk a little bit about what's going on here so you can understand and now you know not in the volume but more about value of moving knobs so by clicking here and dragging I can drag this to any knob you can see there's a plus wherever I can drag it somewhere okay now from there this blue line appears and this blue line is gonna tell us the modulation amount how much do we want to change whatever knob we're on in this scenario how much do we want to open up the cutoff by okay so that's what that blue line does now in terms of the envelope the way you want to see it is change if we increase the attack right an envelope one that that is deciding how long it takes for us to increase the volume to max volume max amplitude in this scenario it's how long it takes for us to go from this side of the knob to the at the end of the blue line so if I wanted to create a wub I would add attack play low then I will use a square kind of there right if you know you know and if you don't enjoy your youth okay so from there a little bit of resonant right we can create sounds like this the other thing is lower the attack back down you know we have this you know an odd mobby sound so here decay is controlling how long it takes for us to go from that end of the blue line back to the original value where the cutoffs at because the sustain is all the way down if the sustain is somewhere in the middle it's gonna linger in the middle now why is this useful here well I'm gonna show you guys why let's say you're making a bass line you're like okay I want to punch you so you pull it down you do this you move this here you go this and you're holding it down but now when you hold it down let's say you're in a song and there's drums the issue here now is is that you can't really hear the bass I mean you can feel the sub right so this is where you might decide to hold the note bring your sustain up you're like okay the bass is fat there and if it was stayed here we should be able to hear it and feel it so now when I play it notice when I increase the release here nothing really happens and the reason for that is because the release in an envelope it's only gonna matter if there's sound to begin with right so if our envelope one the volume there's no volume because we let go and there's no release and you're gonna hear it but if I add the release now you can hear the release kicking in on this the second place that most analog synths allow you to route an envelope to remember the limitations they've set and what most of them have in common is the pitch and there's a lot of techniques here to deal with the pitch okay the first thing is if I go to a sign I can use an envelope and route it here and then I can lower down the sustain to create lasers okay now notice that when I put this on there this line is going left and right it's not going in one direction well that's because we are in bipolar mode now and Serum is gonna decide whether it's in bipolar mode or unipolar mode depending on what you put it on and what the value of that knob or the pitch is so to change that let's you just want to go up and back to the original pitch you're gonna hold option or alt shift click on that blue little knob and you make it unipolar you can also go into the matrix and you're gonna see here polarity and then you're gonna highlight this and bipolar off but if we turn it on now it goes in both directions again and we can also click there to turn it back to a unipolar one now this pitch knob the cool thing about it is one we can create essentially downlifters like so let's put some detunement okay we can create effects like this add a bit of attack this is gonna make it so that the pitch slowly goes up again and then it comes down like very iconic the other thing too is if we go to the right really fast lower the decay we can add like a like almost like a snap on top of the sound use a triangle sounds fucking great I like for creating these kind of create 808 or knocky bass lines this way add a bit of release let's use the distortion here and now boom slam that thing okay the other thing too now is we can also go the other way which gives us a essentially like a hello Chris Slate add a bit of attack right we could do a lot of really cool stuff we can add that to wubs and and so forth okay the other thing we can do this for is check it we can add it to the octave range here and you get that and then the cool thing about serum 2 now is that when you highlight and move it now it tells you where you're going from to what and I love that because back then it wouldn't tell you so you would have to just dial it in by ear and by eye now from there with envelopes the best way to learn them and the best way to learn anything when you learn is to make some sounds so why don't we make a couple of sounds so that you guys can see the workflow on how to use them okay so the first one we can make is a bass so let's make a very really nice stack bass okay so what we're gonna do is go minus 2 on this first oscillator which is gonna be our sub layer or our lower layer for the bass we're gonna go with a square a very common sub oscillator to use for more moggy and aggressive bass lines on the top I'm gonna add a saw minus 1 one octave above this one we're gonna random phase it for now and now we're gonna use a filter out both for them and pull the cutoff back now if you want some tips here from experience to make a good bass that's gonna sound good what I like to do is I'll play this and I'll set the cutoff point by ear where I still hear the bass how I would want it heard when sustained and then I'm gonna use an envelope now to open it up to a certain amount I'm gonna lower down the sustain and there we go a little higher up now the level matters I want where the saw is influencing the bass more than the square but the square is still providing that low-end body the identity of this bass will come from how much you open up by the decay you set, sustain, the resonance and there we go let's add a bit of key track pull it back more and also add the envelope to the resonance if you wanted to now we can make that saw be a seventh let's lower the DB pull we already know what all that does let's change the square to a saw let's get our values right here because you're gonna see the values will really dictate how alive punchy this bass is let's also make sure we have saws that match well together we're gonna use the same one so they don't phase out is that some reverb from Ableton? And notice that the bass, I'm doing it but you don't really feel too much of the punch even though we have stuff going on. And that's because we also have to optimize the volume, right? The envelope can shape the sound with the frequency removal in addition, bringing it back with an envelope, but we also want to play with the volume a bit. Now a key thing here is don't do this because you thin it out too much, but you do want some form of reducement in volume, but not too much. I'm going to add a hint of release just to help whenever I play too staccato-ish. Okay, now the other type of bass I can make is also keep it simple. Here I can increase the resonance to create a very housey bass. Make it a wub by increasing the attack, I'm going to increase the sustain here on this guy. Now let's get creative, let's add a saw, an octave up with detunement. So again, you can do all of that with the basic shapes, in fact, I would make a case that with the basic shapes, if you're making a rolling bass for instance, you know, the important thing is that envelope. Super important because it's going to dictate how your bass sounds. So I'm just going to put an arp here so that it rolls. I'm going to put this at 128 BPM. Okay, now I'm going to play to create a rolling bass. I'm going to also do a shift 12, we'll talk about this once we get to this section, but I'm just doing it to kind of show you a little bit more on the envelope side of stuff. Okay, very important that you set this right, your volume too. Now watch, if I make this too long, bass is fine, right, but it's a little muffled. Here, you feel it more. Switch it to a square. Right, this one maybe you might want a little bit more decay. There you go. Increase this. Maybe this goes more down, so that the bass doesn't sound too fat and muffled. Okay, super cool. We can make that and then from there add another saw here. I'm going to retrig this. I'm going to use a high pass here on this guy, like this. Okay, from there let's make a super saw lead that's very trancey flowy. So we're just going to use eight saws. We're going to switch the algorithm to the super and let's include that. Right now we play this. Kind of boring, so now I'm going to add some release. Right, so then if I play some nice, some chords, like let's say here real quick. Come more to life by adding a filter that's going to add character. Remember filters add character. Let's use maybe a low 28 this time, not the MG low one. And now if we play. Let's use an envelope to open it up. We're going to use a very long decay and release. And let's just dial this in. We're not going to make it too fat. Let's make this punchy right now. And now let's play. More up. Like it doesn't sound dope because as I let go of the note, it doesn't linger enough. So now I can add more release here. Let's make the super saws matter more by optimizing the volume of the super saw. So that it has movement, maybe a bit more attack to make it more flowy, less. And now let's see how it sounds. Still need more release. There we go. That sounds nicer. And as I do that, right, maybe more decay. Let's try even more attack. We'll round it out. We'll add more resonance. In fact, let's add another envelope that increases the resonance and brings it down. And then let's see how that sounds. Let's add another saw. But this saw, I want more of a on top. So now we can add a band pass to layer this B saw more detuned. And we're going to put it more up here. And on this guy, we're also going to add maybe one of these guys here, but not a lot. Just a little bit to help it move. Almost sounds like there's there's some form of reverb, right? And that's because of this guy. It was way too detuned. Let's put this up an octave. Let's try one more time here. Let's play. Right. That was a nice superstar sound. From there, let's make a growl. Step one, we're going to find a nice spectral wavetable because we don't have access to FM and all that. So we can't really do a lot to make growls. But again, we can get creative with it. So let's find a good wavetable that's going to give us some good movement. Let's put it at a bass range. All right. So I got to find a pocket. Once I found that I can use Envelope 2, I'm going to add it at some attack. I'm going to use this to round it out. And I'm going to add something like this to shape it a bit better. And we're going to route this to wavetable position. Okay. And now let's find a pocket. Something that's inspiring. That's cool. Let's add some unison. Okay. Now we're kind of getting something cool, but from here, what makes a growl a growl is manipulation of frequency, which we can do with filters and also the manipulation of the wave. The wave isn't doing enough to get a growl. Now we can use some of these alt warps in order to add even more movement. Let's try adding a PWM, see how that sounds. That doesn't sound growly. That sounds way too like. There we go. Let's play with this. Well, let's see if maybe we can add another layer. Let's keep this bottom. We're going to make this one wide and find maybe another growl wavetable that maybe might help us there a bit better. Get something dope on the sides. And we'll use the same envelope. And let's use the filter to remove some of the lows. There we go. All right, cool. And then from there, let's use a filter. One of the multi ones to give this growl a bit more movement. So let's see what we can do here. I want something like I can get like a low pass high pass together or like some peaks. I'd be sick. Yeah, like these might be cool if we can get a peak in a notch. There we go. So now I can move this one way and the notch another way. Let's see how it sounds. There we go. And now move this. And there we go. If I want to get crazier with the growl, we don't have access to the effects. But again, you know, it's like a practice sesh, right? Use what you know that you've learned in the series so far. So we know those filters are crazy good. So in the filter episode, we learned how we can have filter one go to filter two instead of going straight out. So now they're in serial. Sounds go to filter one and then they go to filter two and filter two. I want to add one of those crazy filters. That's probably going to add a lot to the sound. So let's try an all pass real quick. And let's route it to the cutoff. Try this. There we go. This is making the sound a little too like it's losing high end. So let's use the mix. Color on top. Okay, let's see. Let's see if we can distort these guys in their individual channels with the distort feature. Let's try a sine fold. And then here too on this guy and see what happens there. Cool. Resonance here. Let's put it down. Cool. I like this, but I don't like the shape. I'm looking for something particular. If this is the best we get with this, it's fine. It's fine. Cool. Let's see season two filters. Maybe there's something missing there we can use. Come to let's try that. I heard that one's really crazy. There we go. There's one more thing I want to try and I want to resample this sound by holding C. And then I'm going to go here, click, drag out. And I'm going to put it into a spectral to see what happens. This is going to be like the interesting layer. We're going to do that. Can we do anything here? I know there's some presets we can use. Maybe we can find like a nice. Something cool. That sounds kind of cool. Futuristic. Let's go now to the matrix. I'm going to show you guys a cool trick. We can use Envelope 3 there and then we can do a global master tuning. This is something I saw in some webs where I was like, oh, shit. Like, why didn't I think of that? We're going to go from the bottom up. Unipolar one direction. There we go. OK, let's see. Maybe some attack. Go up instead. There you go. Let's make a re-space. Play it. We're going to now use an envelope to give it more of a hit. Lower it down to this. Long decay. Let's add more saws. Maybe one up an octave here. We go with one voice, one voice. And then fine tune it a bit. There we go. Now we can maybe add another spectral sound wide.  Let's route an envelope to the wavetable position. This is like getting experimental as heck, but you never know. Let me show you guys some other nice sounds that I've been making. I've been practicing because I've been making Minimal Nights Volume 3 for you guys. So I'm going to create something very flowy. I'm going to be using a flute sound from the multi-sample. I'm going to teach you guys something cool. Let's go multi-sample or sample. Actually, I think we need like a pan flute. Let's see if they have it. Yep, it's right here. So what I like to do, I'm going to grab this guy, bring it over here. And then I'm going to go here and we can turn it into a wavetable. I believe by switch to wavetable and in here, let's use 1024. Find a nice spot, detune it. Let's use a filter on that wave to create a wide layer for this flute. Right click or go here. We're going to normalize it. Just to get it loud. Now we create these type of sounds. Okay, so nice to use. With effects, it comes to life like you'll play. It's delay, reverb. It's quiet. Let me show you guys another sick sound. We can use a sine distortion and sine fold it. And then just have it come from up down like this. Slow, slow. And let's omit out the low end. And of course, acid sounds. So if we go here, we can create acid sounds now. High resonance, pull back. Saw to begin with, envelope 2. And. All right. So now you saw how envelopes can help us make pads, leads, wubs, even growls. But in the next episode, we're going to get into LFOs, which will help us bring these sounds to closer to that finish, finish level. It's going to allow us to do a lot of really crazy stuff, so make sure to tune in for that. But with that being said, you guys take care and I'll see you guys next time for another video. You guys take care and have a great rest of your day.",
