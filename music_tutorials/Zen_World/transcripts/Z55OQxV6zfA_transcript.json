    "text": "Yo what's up ninjas, my name is Sam World and welcome to the Complete Guide to Master Serum 2. In today's episode we're hitting the granular and spectral section of Serum 2 which are going to be the most CPU intensive sections of Serum 2 and it's going to be the section which you can say you can break new sonic boundaries, create atmospheres, create glitch like effects, create cool tech house effects, dubstep wubs, you name it. It's all going to be done here. So let's get into it guys. So the granular section, I have a vocal already inputted because I think with a vocal that is saying multiple things, it's the best way to teach granular because then you start to understand how it works and how you can use it. So right now I have this vocal sample which I have, you know I'm going to play right now and this is going to play from left to right. Take your medicine honey and put your house in order. I said take your medicine honey and put your house in order. And you can see how each green bar is moving as I go from the left to the right. Now with granular what you're doing is you're splitting up any sound source into grains and each grain is going to last a certain length and with this length here you're going to control how many, how long that grain is and also how many right because if you have a short length you're going to have a lot of grains. If you have like a two second length and you have four seconds of a sample you're going to have only two grains because each grain lasts two seconds or divided by two right. So with the length we can control the length of each grain. And watch if I put this down you're going to see the green, now there's more. At higher lengths, here we only have one. Take your medicine honey and put your house in order. I said take your. So we're using it as a sampler right like a sample just playing from left to right. However what starts to change is once we start to move this density, this density decides how many grains we're playing at the same time. So right now we only have one which is why it sounds normal. Now what happens if I put 20. Take your medicine honey and put your house in order. I said take your. So it gets louder right because they're all starting at the same time, they're all playing at the same pitch, nothing's really happening so now we have 20 grains playing at the same time. However what if I start to randomize the length of each grain and randomize the pitch of each grain. We'll do it by one semitone here. Take your medicine honey and put your house in order. I said take your medicine honey. You can hear how now we're starting to get this change of like almost like a chorus effect. But what if I randomize the pan, the left and right of each grain. Take your medicine. Take your medicine honey and put your house in order. I said take your medicine honey and put your house in order. Now what if I randomize the starting point, the scan and the starting point here. Take your medicine honey. I'm going to go crazy as you can hear it and let's lower the grain size a bit so you can hear what's going on. Take your medicine honey and put your house in order. It's jumping all over the place right. Certain grains are playing at the end, certain grains are playing at the beginning, certain ones are following the marker right. And that's what granular does. It modulates the timing of the sample of when we're playing and it does that by chopping it into grains and with those grains we can modulate when each one starts, where, if it's pan left or right. We can randomize that. We can randomize the volume of each one. We can randomize the pitch of each one. We can randomize the direction of each one. Is it going straight? Is it reversing? Okay. And we can automate the offset on each one as well. So that way, if it once intended to start a certain spot, it will offset a little bit each time differently. All right. Now we have this. Let's say I play really high up. I'm going to randomize this pan and now we get the glitch effect we were talking about. Now I'm going to reverse this forward and back. I'm going to increase, decrease the length. I'm going to have more. The density's up. So now we have more grains. Okay. Now when we have grains, they're going to be essentially cross fading between each other. So now we click this blue here. This is where you can control how it does it. Okay. So the amount is how much of whatever shape we add, which is like a volume. Think of it like this is going to alter the volume. It's going to affect. So if I do this, this is giving us more of a slow increase of the volume than a decrease of the grain. So if I increase the length, I'm going to lower a lot of this stuff down, play lower. You can see that when I play something, it slowly comes in and put your house in order. I said, take your medicine, honey, and put you lower the length a bit more, put the grain at around. All right. So right now we only have one green plane, so you're hearing the change between each grain. Remember the grains are created by the granular splitting each section up into a little pocket. And as we go between each pocket, this is going to switch and this is going to decide how we blend. So we're going to have multiple different ones. We can see it to the left. So it's more of a, or more of a reverse. We can also randomize each value here with this randomize over this. Now we have this. Let's decrease the scan rate a bit. Now if I put a lead, let's put it at a seventh, I'm going to add reverb and delay. You can see how this helps create something that sounds different that you don't really hear too often. Okay. Now we switch it. Then we have the sync, turkey, decrease the length, and this is what makes it so special. So go through them all. We're going to go here. As granular, you have to hear it in order to understand what you can do with it. Right? This sounds crazy. Like if someone asks me to remake this sound, just using a synth, it would be really hard to do it. Here, I'm still holding down these chords I'm playing. Okay. Let's increase the density a bit more. Decrease the length. See how that sounds. Okay. Let's switch the sound source to something that's a little more like a loop. Let's try a non-tonal loop, like a percussion loop and see what happens with that. I'm going to randomize the time and the offset. Now we get this. I'll play really low. I'm going to randomize the pitch. And you can see how you got some going reverse, some going like crazy, right? It's going forward, some playing at a higher pitch, some at a lower. The other thing too, okay, is we can unison each grain and this is what makes it so CPU intensive because the moment I increase this, each grain is getting detuned. So now look at my CPU. So now another thing is when I detune, I have settings with the detunement. I have a blend, which is similar to the blend that we had with the wavetable. We're going to have the detunement here. We have a stack. If I go back to sample, this is what we started with. We detuned and now we go granular again. So we get, all right, so we have the start point. So we can again, randomize the starting point of the grains for each unison that we created. We can also span, which is the starting point again, like essentially override the original starting point, the range of the detunement and the width. Mono it, increase it. And then we have the spawn pattern, which is going to control when each one starts. So they can all start together with even the timing of each grain. Let's say we have six spread out evenly with exponential. It slowly increases every single time one spawns. So for instance, one spawns in a second, the next one is going to spawn in two and then in four and then in eight, and then we can randomly spawn. Have I right click clear on the image. I can select show XY controller, which if I move this, you're going to see this little dot here. So now this dot, you can set it to control the position. But now if you right click again, you can now have the Y axis control something. So for example, I can have it control the volume, the warp, the grain length. So if I go up and down, I can show the length left to right control the position. So for instance, let's say I get a chord loop real quick. So like this, if I go up and show the length. And by right clicking, I can also modulate Y with something. Like for instance, I can add it to a macro, control it. Density again is going to control this guy here. Let's get rid of the length one. I'm slowing down the scan rate. So now if I move this. Let's randomize the pan. Unison. That's the tune last. We can BPM sync a lot of this stuff. So that way we can just create grains based on the time signature. So every one fourth, there's a grain, which puts it in a, let's see, let's remove this. Yeah, yeah, we got it. But a lead, I'm going to grab the loop here. I'm going to do this and I'm going to try and see if I can trim it. So now we have this trim. Boom. So now I have this little reverb portion of the piano. I can right click and normalize it. Now we have this. So we can sync each one on fourth density. Playing lower. A little off, but that's fine. Dot it. Put the dotted there. Let's make the density lower. I want it to more stutter. So I'm a lower this length. Now I can crossfade between like the sampler here. We have this beautiful sound. Okay. So now wintering the spectral section, right? We're going from time, which green was all about the time. As you saw, we were able to manipulate time in a way where it created very interesting stuff. Now it's spectral. We're manipulating the frequency itself, not the shape of a wave because the wave table has to deal with changing the shape of the saw, right? We can use the warps like a band plus and all that good stuff to shape the sound differently, which and then results in the sound sounding different with spectral. We're using samples. Then we are manipulating the harmonics, the frequencies of it. Whenever I say harmonics, partial, all that means is when I have a sine wave here, I'm playing the first partial that of the note that I'm on because each note like a B, a one, a zero, depending on the octave is going to be related to a certain frequency. So that note, the first mountain you see will be what we call the fundamental. So with the sign, we only have one partial fundamental. From there, we get the overtones, which usually you'll see with a triangle. You'll start to see them. So we go basic shapes, put a triangle. All these new additions here is what we would call partials as well. Okay, so then we're going to have harmonic partials, which are going to be multiples of this guy here. So they're going to be harmonically related. They're going to be multiplied by two, three, four. What spectral synthesis is doing, it's messing with the harmonics of the sound, the frequency of a sound. Okay, so here I have this basic deep stab. First off, start of the sample, end of the sample. I can zoom in, right? The more green it is, the more frequency, harmonic content there is at that specific frequency. From the bottom, we go low frequencies to the top, it's high. To the right here, I can use this to almost like a filter to cut out certain parts. Why is this useful? Well, let's say I have this sound and I want to, let's say, have a stable tone on the sign or that bottom one, then I can use a sign, which is just that one fundamental. Okay, so that's one use for that. I can also, let's say I have a web sound or something, and I want to like add like an interesting texture to it. Well, I can play it by holding A, do the web. Now I can grab that here, bring it here, bring it back in here. Now I have it here. So now this becomes the interesting texture. Now I can grab maybe just the top part, detune it a bit. You know, assuming that's the same thing, I'm just going to do this. Okay, we have that. I'm going to bring that in. So that's what this would be for. But now the other thing, let's say I have a dubstep growl like this, right? A lot of opportunities present themselves now, okay? For example, I can loop like before. We're not really going to dive into this because we already know what it does. It's going to be very similar to the sampler and simpler. But the new thing we get is this cut, this filter where we can alter the frequencies, the harmonics of the sound, and move to create these nasty-ass fucking things. So now I'm going to normalize. So I can alter the harmonic range here. And there's going to be some presets that you can use. As you can see, my remap's here too. You can alter that. And there's also the presets that we can use here. You can also click here and put a wavetable, which you're going to see, which is very interesting. I don't know how I would use that, but just found out what you guys. Now at the bottom here in the warp, we are going to have new features. We're going to have a spectral section now. And all this is going to do is it's a way it's going to mess with the harmonics, the frequencies of this guy up here. So I'm going to switch to a more basic sound. Here's going to smear the harmonics or the transients of a sound. So if you have a drum or something, and it's going to make it sound a little bit more blurry. And then we have spread plus or minus, which is going to spread the harmonics across the frequency spectrum. So, you know, sound design for video games, movies, maybe if you wanted to create a very gnarly uplifter. The next one is harmonics, adding more harmonics to what we already have. You can also add sub harmonics. She's going to add harmonics below the ones you have. So think of it as almost like a sub oscillator. You're going to be beefing up the sound more. Next one we have is a gate. So it's going to act like a gate, but on the frequency itself. So certain frequencies are going to be louder than others when you have a sound, right, depending on how the sound sounds. So with the gate, as we go from the bottom up, you're getting out the quieter ones and leaving only the loud ones. In this instance would be the bass, because it's a bass sound. Robotize is going to add robotic qualities to the sound, usually through pitch correction or modulation. Shift is just going to change the frequency content of the sound. So it sounds like a shift. Mirror is going to start to mirror the frequency spectrum. We're just adding too many harmonics that we already have, just inverting. Peak follow will adjust the frequencies based on the peak amplitude of the signal. So you can see that we remove some of the high end out of there. And when we go down, remove some of it, almost like a filter. Peak octave 12 or minus 12 will change the peak frequency up or down an octave. So... So 12 is 12. Minus 12. Good for tear out dubstep. Peak harmonics minus 12 and 12 just shifts the harmonic content up or down an octave. As you can see all of them being shifted up. Minus 12. So if I play down one octave right now you can hear and put this up but that's all that's doing so it's doing it to the harmonics which spectral has to deal with again the harmonics of the sound so we're just manipulating the frequency. Harm sweep kind of like a filter sweep except with the harmonics. Shepherd's gonna create a shepherd's tone which is just an illusion like the sound is going to keep going up and up and up so as we go from left to right it's going to keep going up. Shepherd W is a variation of that sounds like we have a lot more like of a detuned shepherd's tone with it. By the way these are not even in the manual which is making it a little hard to explain for you guys so I'm trying my best with it. The comb filter is going to add a comb filter to the harmonics of the sound. Similar to like a comb filter you're going to find in Serum 2 which is usually going to be a filter we hatch a lot of peaks and valleys which creates phase alterations to the sound and also changes the tonality of it usually making it sound a lot more interesting in exchange for fatness and in exchange for forward presence of a pitch blend which to be fair I don't know what it's doing. Pitch shift. Pitch shift shifts the pitch up or down all the harmonics just get moved up and down. Phase switch alters the phase of the harmonics sometimes leading to phase cancellation or phase enhancement. Switch the sound. We have a formant which is applying a formant like quality to the harmonic sound which usually formants are going to look like this. Very extreme filters to kind of produce a vocal quality like an A and an OY to the sound. Then we have mask which you're going to need something in Sound Source B or C to use. The idea of it is that you're going to mask some of the signal to allow this one to pop out more. So right now if I mask this sound you can see that it sounds like it's getting spectrally ducked based on whatever sound we put here so if I put this there. Let's pick another one. Then we have a vocoder effect. Still don't have a use for that. So let's do a little quick sound design sesh with the new stuff we did already with the granular like a couple of cool little sounds how we would incorporate stuff. But for now let's see what we can do here. So let's start off with the spectral since we already made a lot of sounds with the granular. I'm going to use a stab. I'm going to let's say go with maybe the spectral one of these guys and use what its strengths are. I really liked how some of these sounded like the subharmonic so add some subharmonic content. Now I'm going to put an oscillator like a Reese we're going to use a filter low pass filter eventually we'll access the filter section next time. But for now we just have to use these here. Let's fine tune here. I'm going to use the warp like that. See if we can use another spectral effect. Let's try the spread. Let's use a filter now to cut out some of the lows. Now you do it like this. So now we have this really haunting effect. Let's see if I can normalize it. Right click normalize. Just to the left here real quick. I'm going to lower the volume down of the sauce like that. It's pretty sick. There we go. Some unison. We have here the unison effects for it similar to all the others. Let's see if we can stack by three. Anything interesting here? Let's use the noise section now to create a nice texture to the sides. Maybe something that's more like a kick. Looping that low pitch. That's kind of scary isn't it? Switch the samples. Anything else comes in? That's cool. Two. Seven. Now we can EQ the highs out a bit to keep it here. Alright. Let's get that 3D effect on the sound by respecting the space and widening this. Trying to see if there's anything else. Maybe lower the scan rate to play it very low. There we go. Cool. And there you go. That's even crazier isn't it? So cool. Let's initialize the sound. So we need something somatic. Anyways guys I'm in a hurry today because my wife knocked on the door like ten minutes ago. So that means I have to get going. But hopefully this video helps you guys out. Towards the end of the video we're going to do sound design sessions and we're going to target more of the spectral. Serum 2 is not letting me import stuff as I usually would. Because usually what I'll do is make a sound and then import it and use spectral to give it that interesting flavor as you guys saw. But with that being said I'll catch you guys next time for another video. Hopefully you guys are having fun learning Serum 2 with me. And again if you guys want to support the channel you can head over to evilsounds.com where you can find all of my sound design work. You guys take care and you guys have a great rest of your day.",
