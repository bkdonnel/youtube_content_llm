================================================================================

[00:00] Beep, beep.

[00:01] When Serum 1 first came out, one of the biggest reasons why I got down on my

[00:05] knees and, you know, I bend the knee, as they say, and gave it the ring and made it

[00:08] my main synth of choice, my main boo, was because of its LFO section.

[00:13] At the time when it came out, I had never seen such a freeing LFO where I could just

[00:17] draw shapes and make knobs move in ways that I never thought was imaginable.

[00:22] And, you know, I feel this is one of the reasons why when you ask drum and bass

[00:26] and dubstep producers, anything with, like, complex sound is saying,

[00:29] what's the favorite synth of choice?

[00:31] Many of them will say Serum because it

[00:33] allows you to do stuff that no other synth could do.

[00:36] Now, of course, we've had synths that have

[00:38] tried to mimic it and been inspired by it, like it's Bastard, it's like Vital and all

[00:42] that, but to this day, it's one of the things that makes Serum 2

[00:46] probably one of the best synths out there for creating very complex sounds.

[00:49] And today you're going to learn it.

[00:52] All right.

[00:52] So the LFO section in Serum 2, there's going to be a lot of LFOs.

[00:56] And as you start using them all up, let's say you make a sound where you're using

[00:59] all six, it starts to give you even more and more.

[01:01] So you could possibly say it's an unlimited amount of LFOs in this.

[01:04] Now, LFO, for those of you guys that want

[01:06] to impress your friends, stands for low frequency oscillators.

[01:09] I guess at the back in the day, you know, as you guys know,

[01:12] analog synths were created by using electricity.

[01:16] You know, they would use electricity to make sounds.

[01:18] And I guess you had these low frequency

[01:19] oscillators below 30 Hertz that they were like,

[01:22] we don't know what to do with it.

[01:24] So I guess someone had the idea of possibly saying we could move knobs with it.

[01:28] We could move knobs with it.

[01:29] And the LFO was born.

[01:30] So we can drag and drop the LFO to the level of this saw sound here.

[01:34] Let's add a bit of unison in Serum 2, man.

[01:36] And we can hear it work.

[01:44] To create this nice flutter beating sound.

[01:47] Now, with every LFO, you're going to have the rate, which is the speed of the LFO.

[02:01] Right, super nice.

[02:02] We already sound pro as heck, right?

[02:04] So, you know, with most LFOs, you're going to have them synced up to the BPM

[02:08] of whatever you're doing and then you're going to have your rate of 116, 1 8th

[02:12] and so forth to the right here.

[02:13] You can also use your trip or dot in order to activate the hippie modes or the

[02:18] the weird modes, which are the modes I rarely use, to be fair.

[02:21] Like, you know, you have a 1 8th dotted, which can work for certain songs.

[02:26] Like if you guys watch Demon Slayer,

[02:28] that movie, you know, on Netflix that got big, the main sound golden.

[02:30] If you wanted to make something like it or the or the rhythm of it,

[02:33] you would have to go into, I believe it's a triplet style.

[02:40] Of foray, because I think one of the sounds

[02:41] that was in that soundtrack, because I remade it, don't ask why.

[02:44] I had to do that in order to get it.

[02:46] So there are usages for it.

[02:47] However, the more popular way is just going to be like so.

[02:50] From there, we can also switch the LFO

[02:52] into Hertz mode, which again, we talked about where low frequency

[02:55] oscillators, what they are, right?

[02:56] You can see 0.3 Hertz.

[02:59] So this is how fast it's moving based on Hertz.

[03:04] And as you notice, as I go from the left to the right,

[03:08] you know, you don't hear no big jumps.

[03:12] Right. And that's what this is useful for.

[03:16] But whenever I want to modulate something

[03:18] that's not synced to the BPM or I want to create some randomness or I want to create

[03:22] a pitch drift effect, this is what I would use in order to achieve

[03:26] that, to add movement to a sound that's not predictable.

[03:28] OK, from there.

[03:31] And Serum LFO is pretty easy to use.

[03:33] We have the mode we're in.

[03:35] We're going to have here this submenu,

[03:36] which we can go into where we have basic rhythmic sidechain, random curve,

[03:40] random flat, and the basics is where you're going to find the standard LFOs

[03:44] you would see in most synths, saw down curved,

[03:48] which we want to saw down.

[03:50] We're going to have flat, which resets that, saw down,

[03:55] saw up.

[03:58] A sine,

[04:01] which is like almost like a wiggle square

[04:04] to create like these

[04:07] pulsing type of sounds.

[04:11] And in a triangle,

[04:13] which is very smooth, one of my favorites.

[04:14] And then from there we go into this

[04:16] rhythmic section where you're going to have more complex

[04:22] LFOs that are user generated.

[04:23] So what that means is these are made by you, by someone.

[04:27] Some people sell presets for these.

[04:28] So if you ever wanted to do a little side hustle, you could sell LFO presets.

[04:32] And then from there we have sidechain as well, which these sidechain shapes,

[04:37] which I think are going to come from the LFO tool.

[04:40] All right. From there to the right,

[04:42] we also have the way that the LFO is going to move.

[04:45] It's going to forward.

[04:46] We'll start from here, move there, come back.

[04:49] We have reverse.

[04:50] It starts from the end.

[04:51] So if I put this on a level

[04:54] and then we have ping pong where it goes to the end and then the reverse is back.

[04:59] To the right of that, we can control the grid size of this.

[05:02] You can go really high, really precise.

[05:04] And you have your X and Y axis controls here.

[05:07] The reason this is very important was because let's say you're creating

[05:10] something and you want to, let's say, make your own.

[05:12] But you want to make this saw have a certain beat or sync up to something.

[05:16] Then we can use these because by holding option click,

[05:19] we can have the dots attached to the grid.

[05:22] And I want to create a web here down the middle.

[05:24] If I don't have that grid,

[05:25] I'm going to increase the grid size going across.

[05:28] And now I can do that. Boom.

[05:30] And then I can lower this down by option.

[05:32] I'm clicking right now.

[05:34] You can see I can also control the slopes like so.

[05:37] Now, if we hear this.

[05:43] OK, let's switch it to forward.

[05:51] We're going to have the LFO modes here

[05:52] for this particular style of LFO, or I believe they might say the same,

[05:57] but free makes it so that this is free flowing.

[06:00] And so if I play and I play again, you can see it's continuing the journey

[06:04] and it's going to keep moving.

[06:05] If I retrig it, you're always starting from the beginning.

[06:09] Now, one thing to note in free,

[06:10] which I really love with the Serum LFO is that right now you can see

[06:13] in the whole section here it's turned on.

[06:15] So this is synced to the to the to the host right now to your BPM.

[06:19] But what you're going to find here,

[06:20] which is super cool, is that if I play, let's say something here,

[06:23] this is still going to stay synced to whatever we have going on here to this rate.

[06:26] But now we're going to be able to add the movement.

[06:33] We have retrig, which we talked about.

[06:36] We'll always make it start from the beginning no matter what.

[06:38] And then we have envelope mode,

[06:40] which is going to make this play once and it's not going to repeat.

[06:46] And then it's going to stay wherever that last

[06:51] dot is.

[06:54] Like so. Now, the cool thing about this is you can also make it loop.

[06:58] And in this scenario, there is a bit of a good strategy to use here.

[07:01] For example, I could have this go here and I could right click and then I have all

[07:05] these settings here, which we're going to talk about in a sec.

[07:07] But I can set loopback point here.

[07:09] So this makes it so that we do everything

[07:11] and then we just keep looping in this little circle.

[07:16] The reason this is useful is you might have a track where, you know,

[07:18] you play on the one and you want it to do bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

[07:24] Now, if I start every note at a different time.

[07:33] Eventually they'll sync up, but you can see.

[07:41] Here I have four notes I'm playing and it sounds like an arp.

[07:44] An arp. It's just that every voice has its LFO and they're all starting at the

[07:48] beginning because we have mono set up, but if you wanted them all to sync up.

[07:55] Then we would activate the mono.

[07:57] To the right of that, we're going to have these settings here,

[07:59] rise, delay, smooth and the phase. I would rise.

[08:03] We're going to have the LFO start at whatever value you set here.

[08:05] So if I put it down, you're not going to hear it.

[08:08] But if I put it here, you're going to hear it there.

[08:11] But what it's going to do is the shape, the modulation it's going to be doing,

[08:14] it's going to be slowly applied based on the speed you set here.

[08:18] So this becomes useful for when you have a sound where you want to play a chord

[08:21] and then you want it to wiggle at the.

[08:22] For example, I'm going to set it to four bars.

[08:28] You can hear how it's slowly coming in to the full modulation, right?

[08:33] It's giving us a full flutter there.

[08:34] The delay delays it fully, so it doesn't even start

[08:39] until

[08:41] the time you've set has passed.

[08:43] From there, we have probably one of my

[08:45] favorite things that is new in the Serum LFO, which is going to be the smooth.

[08:49] This is going to smoothen out the

[08:53] the modulation, making it not sound as I guess you could say,

[08:57] if you have a very jagged one, a very transidy one, it would round it out more,

[09:02] making it sound a little bit more flowy, more smooth, as the name says.

[09:05] For example, if I go here and I use like a crazy like this, I can.

[09:13] Smoothen it out.

[09:17] And you can also see what it does.

[09:20] One way I like to use this mode is by going here to random or random flat.

[09:24] I'll activate that and then I'll smooth it out to make somewhat of a wub

[09:27] depending on whatever this decides to generate for me.

[09:30] And then from there, I'll do this.

[09:31] And now I have this great waveform for a wub that I wouldn't have thought of.

[09:36] It makes my life a little easy.

[09:37] You can see that I have that.

[09:42] We can also use the random flat, which is

[09:44] which square gives us a random squared off.

[09:48] I like using this one with the grid size, of course, because then from there we can

[09:52] create stuff that sounds like it's in beat if we ever decide to put in a kick.

[09:56] Let's go one more time.

[10:04] From there, we have the phase,

[10:05] which decides where we start out at the LFO section.

[10:08] OK, and then from there, we're going to have these little settings here

[10:11] that you can see the coordinate point dot system is the one we've been using.

[10:15] Just doing that, depending on the grid size,

[10:17] these next ones are going to apply it based on the grid size you have set.

[10:21] So they're going to be determined by that and how long they're going to be.

[10:24] Here we have a flat.

[10:25] We have a slope up.

[10:27] If we wanted to add that, notice how it locks into the bottom

[10:30] part there and it stays within each little box.

[10:33] So if I increase this like so,

[10:35] you're going to see that now we're going to have more of.

[10:36] So from there, we also have a slant, a slant down.

[10:41] OK, and then from here, we can click here to open this up more.

[10:45] I'm pretty sure you can probably make it bigger or not.

[10:47] And now you're going to be able to get very precise with what you do.

[10:50] Or in case you ever wanted to see LFOs up close.

[10:53] Well, now you can tell people that you have seen LFOs up close.

[10:56] We have a lot of new LFO modes, by the way.

[10:58] Back then we we didn't have access to these four here.

[11:01] All right. So the next thing we have is path.

[11:03] I rarely use this one, but pretty much the the theory here would be to create a path.

[11:10] Again, we're still going to be controlling the the knob,

[11:13] but we're using a different system for it where we can draw nice shapes.

[11:15] If you choose to.

[11:17] I'm not sure we can draw a heart, but let's say I do something like this.

[11:20] All right. Let's say there.

[11:22] Now I have an X and Y axis, so that's going to control again how we're going

[11:26] to change knobs across the X or Y axis, depending on where we're at.

[11:28] So I might want let's say let's get creative with this.

[11:31] We're going to pick another another wave table here.

[11:35] Let's pick a monster.

[11:36] Our X is going to control the wave table.

[11:38] Let's add an alternate warp here, a band minus plus to give it that.

[11:42] And our Y is going to alter that.

[11:44] And let's go slow.

[11:49] Let's add another dot.

[11:55] OK, and I'm pretty sure they're going to have some shapes

[11:59] and someone took time to make that a nice little flower.

[12:02] I don't know if there's a serum.

[12:07] I guess that's fine.

[12:08] I don't have that much time, though, I'm trying to make some bomb sounds, right?

[12:11] But whoever made these cool, man.

[12:14] Another way we can use this is also to create what I would call

[12:17] the sounds that sound like they're revolving around your head.

[12:19] X controls the level.

[12:20] Y will control the pan.

[12:26] So it looks like, yeah, we have access to these where we can close the circles,

[12:30] I believe, but then we have one that just leaves them open.

[12:33] So that's going to be the system.

[12:35] If you right click as well,

[12:36] you can modulate any of the coordinate points, which is something I didn't specify.

[12:39] You can do this in all the modes,

[12:41] by the way, except the last three that we're going to go over.

[12:44] For instance, I can modulate this with

[12:47] LFO 2.

[12:49] And one usage for this for me personally is just to create randomization.

[12:53] So it doesn't always sound the same.

[12:55] And also when I make presets, sometimes I want to wow my users.

[12:58] Right.

[12:59] So I'll do like modulations and they're going to be like, how the heck did he do that?

[13:03] So in a sense, it also adds the wow-ness factor.

[13:05] Like if you ever are in a session with a big producer that invited you to make

[13:09] music and you want to blow his mind in a good way, you know, not in that way.

[13:14] We know that goes happens a lot.

[13:15] You know, how did some people get to the top?

[13:18] Anyways,

[13:19] you could do some, you know, you can do some of those parlor tricks there and have fun.

[13:25] Maybe draw their name.

[13:26] And next thing you know, they offer you a release on their label,

[13:29] the Chaos Rossler and a sample and hold.

[13:32] So the Chaos Lawrence and Rossler.

[13:34] I'll be honest with you guys, I don't know what they do,

[13:37] but they're going to use the same system as the past X, Y.

[13:40] It's going to be crazy hectic.

[13:42] It's going to be based on the rate as well.

[13:44] We can slow it down.

[13:45] The way that I've used it, however, is to create pads that sound again,

[13:49] I guess the word would be binaural pads that sound like crazy movement

[13:54] that isn't predictable, that sounds different than using traditional LFOs.

[13:59] So, for example, let's grab a nice, a nice little wave here like this.

[14:06] And let's route this X to the level.

[14:09] We're not going to go all the way down.

[14:10] Alt shift click.

[14:11] We're going to make it bipolar, call the therapist.

[14:14] Then the Y here acts as well.

[14:16] Now let's play this.

[14:19] And

[14:21] let's go a little more crazier, pull it up more.

[14:25] And also that Y here and let's go faster,

[14:28] actually, Hertz mode.

[14:33] I mean, that's just crazy.

[14:36] It's like.

[14:38] It just randomly goes in a fast.

[14:42] You create these very cool sounds that are very, I guess,

[14:47] dreamcore, I guess is the word I'm trying to use.

[14:49] I really don't know my genres, but I got to catch up.

[14:52] 

[14:54] almost granular like as well.

[14:56] Then, you know, try it out.

[14:58] X.

[15:01] You know, let's add our envelopes.

[15:10] From there again, the chaos, Lawrence and roster,

[15:13] I'm going to assume they're going to move differently.

[15:15] Looks like the roster moves in a circle here.

[15:17] So it's going to let the aliens know that they can land or something.

[15:20] But let's find another really nice

[15:23] or nice, I don't know, wave table there.

[15:25] Let's let's let's let's keep it like, you know, proper here, fam.

[15:29] And I make sounds that sound to, you know, you know what I'm trying to say.

[15:34] If you want to give Noisia a run for their money,

[15:39] it's like, God damn, how'd you make that sound?

[15:41] And now, you know, and then, you know, maybe we'll wrap more stuff in here.

[15:45] Let's see how it works.

[15:46] X on this.

[15:54] I mean, that's nasty, man.

[15:56] But again, if I was making drum and bass, I'd be like, you know,

[16:00] it's just like I found the sound of the youth.

[16:02] All right. Below that, we have the sample and hold,

[16:04] which is going to be more of a generative style of LFO that gives you squared off

[16:09] squared off modulation, similar to where if we were to go on normal and do this

[16:13] old shift or I don't even know what I'm doing there.

[16:16] Go dot shift boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[16:19] Now, these types of modulations are going to sound kind of a bit sample and holdish.

[16:23] I guess that's what I'm trying to say, where it sounds like this.

[16:28] But not as nice, like more like

[16:34] noise.

[16:40] Slow it down a bit.

[16:46] OK, but now you have a generative one that gives you random and I'm going to show

[16:50] you guys something clutch here that can create generative sounds here.

[16:54] So but the way I'm going to do it,

[16:55] I'm going to grab a spectral LFO, I'm going to route it there to the wavetable.

[17:01] And it's going to create this.

[17:03] I believe we can zoom in and out as well with these.

[17:10] But now if we use the smooth, we can smooth it out and now we have more of these curves.

[17:17] Now we can generate essentially a lot of growls

[17:21] with these crazy shapes.

[17:26] You know, let's add a distortion here, actually, and you'll see what I mean.

[17:29] This is going to get crazy real fast, fam.

[17:40] Again, you can lock BPM,

[17:42] lock this, so if you ever find something cool.

[17:48] Add another one, like bend minus warp or something there.

[17:54] Let's see.

[17:56] That's two, let's stack so we cover more range.

[18:04] And

[18:05] also add another one generative, of course, a bar and smoothing it out.

[18:14] Let's get rid of this.

[18:19] There and let's do the anima thing.

[18:24] Round it out.

[18:29] And then from there, I just want to make sure we hit everything.

[18:31] But I think we have that is the LFO section.

[18:35] Now, like I said, the more LFOs you use, let's say I decide to be fancy here.

[18:39] Boom, just hit everything.

[18:40] You know what I mean?

[18:42] I don't know.

[18:43] Then as I boom, I get more LFOs here.

[18:46] Look, look at that, man.

[18:47] I don't know if we get more than that.

[18:48] Let's just keep sending it to stuff, see what happens right now.

[18:52] Now, I think we get a max of 10, as you can see there.

[18:55] So with that being said,

[18:57] it's time to make some sounds.

[19:01] The first sound we can make is a very nice

[19:03] deadmau5 based sound because, you know, everyone thinks LFOs, they think of deadmau5.

[19:07] We're going to use a low pass filter, MGLO 2 with a saw.

[19:12] This filter is or this sound is the one million dollar sound, I would say,

[19:16] because it definitely made deadmau5 very rich.

[19:18] Now, of course, I'm not taking away from his musical

[19:20] composition side because the man made amazing music.

[19:23] And, you know,

[19:25] if we put this here, one eight,

[19:28] let's set our BPM to one twenty eight.

[19:38] Put some reverb.

[19:42] OK, now I'm going to use this chord feature inside of Ableton and I'm going

[19:47] to use the scale feature to do a minor chord.

[20:15] My thought process is we have these sounds that are staple, right?

[20:18] These are iconic sounds that when you use them, people like it because it's familiar

[20:21] and they're proven to work sounds, which means that they've been used to make amazing music.

[20:25] The problem with those sounds is as a sound designer, I can't keep selling, right?

[20:29] I can't keep creating those sounds and supplying them.

[20:31] So how do I reinvent the wheel?

[20:33] A lot of the times I reinvent by just using the same sound, but just layering on top of

[20:37] it.

[20:37] For example, let's use a wavetable here, just to give you a simple example.

[20:43] And we're going to use the prime.

[20:44] I don't know how it sounds, but we're going to respect this sound.

[20:47] And this is going to be a wide layer that's going to sit on top of it, maybe one octave

[20:51] up, lower the volume.

[20:54] And let's play that, and now we get that nice layer.

[21:06] And maybe the octave is going to switch, be generative.

[21:10] Let's use the sample and hold.

[21:12] This is, by the way, a new concept here.

[21:13] I don't know if it's going to work, but it's just something I was like, you know, I'm here

[21:15] with you guys and we're chilling, we're vibing, making dope sounds, so it might work.

[21:21] Let's make it a little louder.

[21:42] We can use something else, like a scale.

[21:48] Right, we can route it to its own filter as well.

[21:51] Filter 2 now, and we can have it do, with an LFO, just keep coming up like this.

[22:13] Let's go monster.

[22:16] Let's give it other chords.

[22:21] I want to create a wub that's going to do, sound a little more better than what we did

[22:26] with the envelopes, so we're going to be able to actually shape it differently.

[22:36] Let's slow it down a bit.

[22:40] And now we can square it off.

[22:45] We can add an LFO, which is going to move it up and down, maybe like, go.

[22:49] And we're going to activate envelope to make it just, again, repeat once and that's it.

[22:55] A little too high up, we can move it down.

[23:00] Let's lower this down.

[23:04] Let's add maybe two voices of unison.

[23:08] There we go, we're going to use a filter, let's also distort it here.

[23:13] With, let's try a sine shaper.

[23:17] And now on the LFO here, I'm going to overcomplicate this.

[23:21] I'm going to do a cool pattern for it.

[23:25] I'll click boom there like this, but let's modify this to be maybe different.

[23:41] Now let's give this filter at the end.

[23:44] We can go click here, make it go to filter 2.

[23:48] That way filter 2 goes to the main and then let's apply filter 2.

[23:52] One of these crazy filters that we love.

[23:58] There we go, let's add a sub now to support the sound.

[24:04] Direct out on it or main is fine.

[24:06] We don't want it routing to a filter.

[24:09] If you want this to follow the sound,

[24:13] then you can create this here to the level so it follows.

[24:18] And then as well here to this guy so that there's change of volume.

[24:28] From there we can also use the noise and do it to the noise there.

[24:32] Let's use the geyser to add a bit of a crunch to the sound.

[24:37] Go into color, geyser.

[24:40] Let's widen it.

[24:43] That's sick, isn't it?

[24:46] Noise.

[24:48] Now let's see if we can find something a little cooler.

[24:52] Maybe like the ring monster or the formants are cool, I know that.

[24:56] Let's try a band reject.

[25:00] Switch to LFO.

[25:04] Slower down the level of the geyser.

[25:06] In tech house we get that sound.

[25:09] So we can do that one very easily right now.

[25:11] Go into the filter, we're going to use an LFO.

[25:15] Just play one note.

[25:17] We're going to hurt.

[25:20] Now let me show you guys here with envelopes you can modulate anything.

[25:23] So one popular thing to modulate would probably be.

[25:28] This rate to have it go from up to down.

[25:30] So I can drag it here, we're going to the max amp.

[25:33] And we're going to lower down the envelope sustain.

[25:38] We can still hear it because it's being routed to both.

[25:42] So let's do this.

[25:50] Now we can play chords.

[25:59] Let's do something that they would do in melodic techno.

[26:02] Use the sound here, maybe put it at 1% or 2%.

[26:06] And let's just have it go.

[26:09] Like so.

[26:11] Another cool thing to do with LFOs is apply a bit of a pitch strip.

[26:15] So the way I'll do that is grab the LFO, put it on the fine here.

[26:18] And then I'll add this nice little envelope change.

[26:21] 

[26:21] 

[26:23] We're going to free it.

[26:24] And we're going to lower down the amount and the speed a bit.

[26:40] Let's add another saw.

[26:42] Detune them slightly and do the same exact thing.

[26:49] So let's grab a multi-sample.

[26:51] And now we can create gated sounds a lot easier.

[26:54] So we can grab a choir sound like an ah.

[26:56] Both.

[26:59] And we can add it here.

[27:01] The level.

[27:03] I'm going to apply a bit of a sustain release.

[27:09] I'm going to shift, hold and do some nice sounds here.

[27:23] Mono it.

[27:29] Saw.

[27:33] We're going to use a filter.

[27:35] I'm going to add a high resonance.

[27:36] And when I play this I want the filter to move to the right.

[27:39] So we're going to move it like so.

[27:44] But I also want it to gate a bit.

[27:46] So I'm going to create more of a micro modulation with the LFO 2.

[27:50] And we're going to do it like this.

[27:57] And now we create that.

[28:07] We can also create that while hitting here and going into a sample.

[28:10] So I'm going to hold and just generating random every 8.

[28:26] You can also switch this to a band pass.

[28:31] Now let's fine tune this guy, pull it back.

[28:34] The blue modulation amount.

[28:41] Some noise.

[28:46] Now we can add unison.

[29:04] You can make something like that where it's slowly coming in.

[29:07] Then we're going to do this.

[29:09] Now we can use this as an envelope here instead of an LFO.

[29:22] Apply release so the LFO continues giving us that nice...

[29:29] Let me show you guys a cool trick here with our envelope.

[29:31] If we lower down the...

[29:35] Just go straight down and increase the sustain.

[29:40] On this guy, put it on here.

[29:42] But let's put this down to where we want to go.

[29:46] Or up to where we want to go.

[29:47] And pull it down to where it's zero.

[29:52] Here.

[29:54] Let's apply a lot of release.

[29:58] Now we're going to hear that sound.

[30:04] Here.

[30:28] We need to get some of these voices to pan left and right.

[30:32] Let's use the chaos now.

[30:35] The pan there.

[30:53] I wonder if I play multiple notes what happens.

[30:56] I'm going to increase the polyphony.

[31:13] I really like that.

[31:14] That is one of the coolest effects I've heard.

[31:20] So that concludes the section for LFOs.

[31:23] And as you guys saw, we can do a lot of really good, crazy stuff with LFOs.

[31:26] But the most important thing to think about LFOs is constant movement.

[31:31] The difference between envelopes and LFOs is that

[31:32] 

[31:32] Envelopes and LFOs is going to come down to the fact that LFOs can loop.

[31:35] As long as you're holding down a note.

[31:36] And they will continue to do what they're doing if there's any form of release on the sound.

[31:41] But as you saw, it makes it easier to make more interesting wabs.

[31:44] You can do crazy things with it.

[31:46] So definitely try it out guys.

[31:48] And with that being said, I'll catch you guys next time for another video.

[31:50] You guys have a great rest of your day and I hope you're enjoying this series.
