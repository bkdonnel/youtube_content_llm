    "text": "Beep, beep. Yo, what's up, ninjas? Welcome to the Complete Guide to Master Serum. Today, we are going into a section which it's above my pay grade, but I feel like I can explain it in a way where it will make sense to most of you. And from there, if you want to become experts at it, then make a plug in by that point, because to become an expert at the wavetable editor, you got to know how to input formulas and math. And I only got to calculus. And after that, I said sayonara. The way to access the wavetable editor, guys, is going to be pretty simple. We've already seen the pencil. OK, so I'm going to put this down here. So we're going to access it by going to the saw top right. Boom. That little pencil button. Now, the purpose of the wavetable editor is to create your own wavetables, which we already know is the color of your sound. And from there, we can also create custom morphs, custom tables with multiple sub tables, which are going to be here. Number four, five, six, seven, eight, all the way to up to nine for this whole wavetable in order to morph between them. Or to provide yourself or your users, in essence, a certain color palette like you can call this like the sky palette, right? Light blue, blue and purple and orange and yellow. And then that's the palette. That's the wavetable. OK, so we can do that with that. Now, with the sine wave, which we've talked about is a purest waveform. If I were to play a note, let's say here like the A at a very low octave where it's bass, you can see that I'm hitting fifty four point nine hertz. Now, the thing at the very top of Serum 2 that you can notice here, all these bins are going to be related to the harmonics, the frequency of the sound at the very beginning. We have been one, which is my fundamental, which is just going to be that. Now, every note is going to be associated with a certain frequency. And if you see there's these little gray outlines here, these gray islands are just going to signify the A at different octaves. So pretty much here we're a one. This is going to be the A2. We can highlight here and you're going to see A2 from here. You're going to highlight this A3. OK, there we go. Then we're going to have a four and then we're going to have a five and then we're going to have a six and then, you know, we have a nice little organ sound. That's how this top part pertains. Now, everything in between that, you can kind of think a bit about it like a piano keyboard is the notes in between the harmonics in between the semitones in between and between the tone. So what this is all going to be about is creating wavetables, right? In theory, if you create something like this that comes from the top down, like this, you should be able to create like a saw type of sound. It sounds like a saw, like a foot, but you should be able to create a saw. If I right click, I believe here I can generate a saw, as you're going to see. And there it is. Now, at the bottom of that is going to be the relationship on phase for each harmonic that you have. OK, and this is where you're going to control it. OK, I can also choose to generate a saw here. And you can see that. OK, cool. We have a saw and it's just randomized, which will give us different results, randomized. Boom. We can also randomize the top. We can randomize the bottom. So you can see there. Boom. So this is cool for generating really cool tones. You can see this one here. Kind of normalizing itself. You're going to be able to randomize or create a saw or a clear the band, so pretty much a low, like you can remove all the high harmonics clear. So it's like a high. Right. And then if I have all the low ones, let's say, and I just want to make it less savvy if I'm playing low. So so we have those there. Let's knit again, go back to our trusty sign. So from there, progressive fade. So if I have something, I believe as the name entails, right, we're going to progressively fade, which I hope my barber does when he cuts my hair. You know, I want to see it progressively fade. You know, I don't want to see a sudden fade. Right. But if we do progressive fade, it's just boom. We can shift it up an octave. We can shift it down an octave. OK. Can always go back to the trusty saw. If you find you make a poo poo type of wave tables and then we can repeat the bin group. So pretty much from from from at the very bottom, we have these sections draw even harmonics only. So as I'm drawing, let's say here, I'm only going to draw the even ones, which are going to be something tasty. And we can draw odd harmonics as well, which is going to be more of a square type of sound. Let's go down like this. It's more of a square, almost like a guy making a synth and you want to provide very strong harmonics. We can right click and scale frequency values by bin index, which I prefer, to be fair, because it doesn't make it look so tiny. So I'm going to turn that on one more time. Boom. Now I can see a lot better. Like there is a ceiling to it at the very top. A hundred boom, if we do random boom. OK, I have that scale frequency on. So that helps a lot in making this stuff. When we randomize, you make a lot of these very like buzzy like sounds, which sound very electric can also work for dubstep, I would say, because, for example, here, if I can randomize this one as well and I go from this to this, I can create a morph by going now into processes and morph and then do a crossfade between these two here. Now, the way I use the top in the most for my sound design work, I'll click here and usually I'm using it to make organ based sounds. You know, maybe I'll like have something like this where I want. You know, a little bit of these middle, which are not related to the fundamental, but provide more body to the sound. From there, at the bottom, we can also draw in our wave tables. For example, here, we're going to have our brush settings and here we're going to have our wave table. OK, so we can have a sign, for example. So each note here can turn into a wave. Turn into a sign like so, you know, it's almost like there. I wouldn't like this guy being my barber just saying, OK, we're going to have this little ramp up. I notice as I do it, it's all going to pertain and be focused on these little grids that which we can control here by moving down. So that way I can have this and it's literally just drawing it. Or I can select the grid of one to one, which is just going to input the shape. One to one like this, boom, made us all like that easy. Concave, then I can start to use the other ones at the bottom, which will work on what you have. And essentially make the shape less stiff. Or give it a certain. Move and we can also nudge and we can add the noise. So if you're making tear out dubstep, this is what you would probably want to be using. Which creates the buzzy sound. OK, so now as you're creating your wave table, your sub tables here, as we were talking about that in the beginning. Right. They don't have to do this by. Default, right, you can have a select color palette, but the goal, if you're making a way to that, you want to, let's say, make a path. Then definitely you want some smoothness to it. So that's where the right side is going to come into play, because this is where you're going to apply the morph once you've created all your sub tables. And this is where you're going to process either single sub tables. For instance, we have a normalized, which is going to make it so that you make the amplitude of that wave at least hit the ceiling. So whichever comes first, that will hit the ceiling and then it will stop to increase the volume. From there, you can remove the DC offset, which usually occurs with heavy distortion. We can flip the polarity. In vertical or horizontal, we can shift the horizontal zero crossing so we can make it essentially smoother as it transitions from this side to that side. We can knit it, which is what I was looking for last time. We can fade in the edges. Boom, slight and let's see here. X-fade edges similar to the one, just a different option. We can filter it. So it's almost like a low pass filter. A lot of times you can get the filter on the whole thing, which almost makes it like a low pass filter. We can sample Redux grid size to the grid size. So, for instance, if I go 20 like that crazy and then we sample Redux, we can essentially square it, make it sound like almost like it's getting lower in quality or crunching it a lot. And then we can send to the noise oscillator, which I didn't know you could do that. And it's here. So we go, we can key track that as well by I believe there is somewhere to key track boom. But again, like I said, with a lot of sounds that you can hear that sound cool, they're usually playing at a very low octave. So that's where we hear that at the serial pitch. But if we go high enough, we'll eventually start to hear the sound itself. The next one is going to be for all the sub tables that you have. So, for instance, the first one is normalize each gain separately, which premature we did with single each one. So I'm just going to look at each one and normalize. What that means is the at least one of these has to hit the edge and then that's normalization. You just kind of put it at max amplitude. And if something touches the tip, it stops growing. I was going to make a joke, but you get it stops. It doesn't keep going. So if I do each, each one's going to do it individually, reach the tip. So it reaches it here. It reaches the top here again. It can also hit the bottom first here, right here. We can undo that by, I believe, just hitting the undo here. Boom. OK, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then the bottom one is between all of them. So whichever hits first, even if some of them don't reach their max amplitude again, it's going to be based on all of them as a whole and then all. So, again, these are going to affect most of them. This is where I have to go into the manual to give you guys some definitions. This is above my pay grade. Not to say I don't use this stuff when I'm making wave tables, but it's more of an experimental thing of like, what does this do? Ah, that sounded cool. Not to play around with the rest. What I'm going to do is I'm going to go into spectral and I'm going to copy some of these waveforms like this one. I'm going to go to oscillator B. OK, so I have one. So I'm going to paste the one I just copied here. I'm going to go back, select another wave table from from here. See, let's go just here to a monster one like here. Boom. So we have these three right now, three sub tables. We can first off, filter them all to make them more subby. Can remove the fundamental, which becomes very useful for when you're making bass lines, you remove that first note, which if you're playing low enough will usually be the bass, the sub part of the bass. So if you're layering multiple bass tones together, you can use that so that you don't have a low end that's fluctuating in volume, beating, detuning. So that's where that becomes useful. From there, below that, we have remove low spectra grid size. From what I read in the manual, it's going to pertain, as you saw here, remove all of this. OK, we'll go back from there, the other one, remove low faces, which is only the bottom one, as you saw here. OK, so again, that bottom one controls the phases as we were talking about the phase, the position of each. You know, harmonic that we're adding. OK, below that, we can sample redox all of them, so we create that crunch effect on them all. OK, as we keep going down, we can resize tables to half the number. So one more time, as you can see, we multiplied it to two. Instead of one, oh, good thing we have an undo. One more time, we have we have three, so we're going to boom, half each one and create. Three new wave tables. And if I want to go through. Super cool, you make the most out of each one. We're going to do that one more time. We keep going. We can also resize half. So it's going to make it to one or two, as you can see. And we hear this one, we end. So it's cool because it's like experimental in nature and allows you to create more from what you have, which I think is pretty cool. From there, we can create a PWM pulse with modulation out of the one we've selected. So what that is, usually it's going to be the shift of the middle to the left, which sounds super cool. It's more fratty movement. And you also have the PWM, which we talked about in one of the earlier episodes. Similar to it. In order to add more movement to a sound, sounds very futuristic. OK, here we have set spectra, this frame in all. Boom, you can see that the top part there. Boom, it's changing to this, so we're turning like that frequency to all of them, but the phase below stays the same. We can set the phases, this frame in all, and we can do the other oscillators as well. We can subtract spectra from the other oscillators, so that's going to pertain to the other one. So pretty cool. From there, we can blur. Them from there at the bottom, we have the more section, which is the more important section I would feel if you must know anything, it would definitely be that section, because this section is what's going to allow you to morph these three to create a full out wavetable with 256 essentially images to it. So if I'm more crossfade, you can see now I'm at 256, which is the max. And we've created a wavetable, a wub style of table, right? Very easily. If I undo that now, right, I remove that whole morph and I'm stuck with the tone palette. I think about it like this. I can go through all the colors now. I have a couple of ways to morph spectral and crossfade. So now I can use spectral. Guys, you can see there and then we have zero fun face. So the fundamental, the phase of the fundamental is set to zero and then we can also zero all the phases. So I'm going back here. So all the faces, boom, as you can see here, we lose all of these that we've added before, which creates like a dinner sound. Personally, spectral first one is the best one. And the crossfade with that in mind, let's make some wavetables. And as we make them, I'll explain the rest of the stuff that pertains to them. So I'm going to remove all the wavetables by clicking here. Clicking there. OK, I am going to put a sign, which I believe if we go to a certain section, we can put down here a formula where we can just get the sign and then we have all these. And this is the part where I'm talking about, like you can get into the math stuff. Like, for instance, here, there's one called Michelangelo waves. Like, what is that? I mean, if someone understands all that, that's great. I don't understand. I recognize the terms. I just don't know how it all makes sense together. But it's there, the Fibonacci. Yeah, just math, math, math, bro. So you can definitely do that. However, for me, for us mere mortals, I'm going to go and just generate a nice little saw for me. Then I'm going to click all and I'm going to remove everything except that one there. I believe I should be able to do that. Remove all except selected single removal somewhere here. Maybe I can right click on it. Move all but selected. Oh, there we go. Remove. All except selected. So here you're going to be able to remove and you have various different ways to do it. You can select multiple and remove. You can remove everything from beginning to the selected from the selected to the end and vice versa. And then we can also reduce the way from there. So from here, we start with a sign. Let's see what we can make. So I'm just going to start putting stuff in. When a set frequency by index, it's a lot easier for me to make something that doesn't sound too fucked up. Just trying to get a certain tone. I think it sounds pretty cool. I want more low end. There we go. See if we can add some more phase changes here. When I click, let's see if we can boom. OK, make another one. Maybe this one gets fuzzier. Just to draw it in. Sure. Let's make a little square. It's a hell of a morph. Trying to shape it better. Just undo those. It's this one. Lost a bit of the fuzziness. I'm gonna set this like a wave there we go let's try applying like a flange see what we can move but now go we can I forgot to mention this last time but we can grab wavetables and turn them to full shapes there you go maybe we go the other one add a sub because we are missing it add some good old OTT that's the cheat code to life let's see if we can make this more interesting we got that cool sound if I wanted to add more mid-lows I could there's a bit lacking here so I can either choose to put in another sine there we go that's bringing us to life now we're in a different ballgame now we're with the pros we're fucking with the pros as they say why don't we try adding a convolution reverb and let's remove this we're gonna use the low split high so that way I can target more of the highs with that cab again one more time just to give it a tone on top I already committed to this so I'm gonna choose to go forward with creativity I find if you like your ideas to do that go for it there's no right or wrong let's make one more for this one I want to teach some other stuff on wavetables because right now the way we have wavetables it's fun but there's a funner way of doing it where it's not so complicated so for example to have a sine I'm gonna FM or PD phase distort from B so I'll create the standard that tone I can also back in the day hopefully we can still do it I can go to the menu and I can resample which it looks like render oscillator warp a or resample oscillator a right so I can render the warp so we're gonna resample to a so now that shape that we had there is here right so boom so I can copy that since we have an oscillator see I'm gonna use see us the one where I'm gonna drop all the tones I'm gonna create I'm gonna paste that there boom so now let's see what else can we do to this guy maybe we can go further so now I'm gonna do the same resample to oscillator a warp to there so now we have the sound you heard so now again I'm gonna copy it's no faster way of doing this would be dope too by the way paste that there's now we have something smooth cool we have that sound now let's try undoing that because I don't like where it went but I'm still gonna follow it because again with creativity you can't overthink them again I don't know what I'm gonna get out of this but my goal is to create something cool smooth creating wavetables is an art in its own as you can see so now the bend is in the wavetable right so then if I wanted to have that boom copy that copy it somewhere interesting see boom Oh lost okay it decided to ruin I think I fucked up but it's okay we can follow that maybe it's a gift from God or the universe so I'm gonna go here I like the idea of this one or there we go that one boom we're gonna copy that go to see make a new one bam bam paste boom make a new ones make a new one here for this one let's see we're gonna do let's do an ephemera of PD again with another with a sign keep it simple sample to a boom and then we're gonna copy that C will paste and there we have four okay so now I can remove these for three tones I've decided on let's play let's just make this one a little bit more like so and now what I want to do is I'm gonna either one grab all of them and either do my processing with it so let's fade the edges in from there again you can use any of these I'm gonna choose to I mean I should be happy with that maybe these guys here are set so that it transitions smoother so let's see I mean yeah they sound very similar now let's undo that though because I'm not a fan of that sound we could try the this one I mean I like the these guys I don't like these so I could just have that I'd be dope but nope how about we make six out of the ones we have there we go okay still not happy with that so we're just gonna morph crossfade so that's cool so now it's like we're going from this very bassy harmonic sound to that and we find a pocket right so that first wave table I would say could use a bit of filtering so I'm gonna actually gonna single and filter it a bit fade edges filter and also the middle one we're gonna do that as well now well let's use some alts here and make something we'll see what we come up with there we go I want to go slower got a good tone let's see if some distortion will help add maybe some more but I want to be careful because if I add too much distortion it becomes more of those buzzy ones that we were let's try I need something it's gonna give us life but not too much okay let's put a  I'm gonna go matrix bipolar just once I get something cool I really don't know what I want here I'm thinking because I'm already at a point with the sound where it's cool but it's missing that wow factor definitely need a sub maybe we need more dynamic movement better maybe we go flange comb could possibly work there we go it's a little funky I always like these type of sounds I don't know why slower the resonance okay we got distortion we need more low end less yeah and we're gonna OTT it I always like looking at my span it helps put some more voices I have femming because I feel like I want more upper harmonics on it so that's what I'm gonna do it let's try doing it might be too much movement but I need mids bro I don't need more highs that's what it's saying oh man it's gonna be one of those sounds that yeah just kind of like just went too crazy with it but it's all good we're gonna finish it I'm gonna add some mid-lows maybe we try some form of movement here remove this let's add some reverb put some makeup on this I'm gonna add a saw usually that works  PDA that's a lot better move that that's a thing man more OTTs, maybe distort more here let's move this guy slight some echo might be dope nevermind, nevermind trying out different stuff or restart the sound if i don't like where i'm headed with it mechanical fun all right guys i hope you guys have been enjoying the complete guide to master's serum next video i believe we're gonna be finishing up serum 2 from a standpoint of view of mastering maybe the wavetable editor not so much but like i said before wavetable editor it's a whole art in its own something definitely to get into if it intrigues you i i say go for it uh but with that being said i'll catch you guys next time for another video you guys take care and much love",
