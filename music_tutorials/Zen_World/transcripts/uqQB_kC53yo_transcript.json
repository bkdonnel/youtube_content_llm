    "text": "Yo, what's up ninjas and welcome to the complete guide to Master Serum 2. If you're still here with me, let's keep each other accountable, dude. You know, we've got to make it to the end because not everyone's going to make it to the end. OK, in today's video, we're talking about filters, which is all about manipulating the frequency of the sound you've created in your oscillator section. Now, reasons we might want to manipulate the frequency, right, is to create warmth. We would remove some of the high frequencies to, you know, hide better, to make it feel warmer, to create fatness, character in the sound, to remove lows so that the sound sounds a little bit more high-endy, a little bit more bitey. Maybe we're trying to emphasize a certain part of the frequency range to create acid style sounds. We want more squelch. Maybe we want to be unique. So we start using more of the crazy filters. For the filter section in Serum 2, we are going to have two filters. Once we go over one of them, I'll explain why we would want to have two filters and how you're going to use that like a pro. And I'm also going to explain how we can manipulate the filter so that you get serial or parallel, which we'll talk about in a sec. So first things first, the filter section, right, we're going to have this tab here where we're going to go into the sub menus, normal, multi, flange, misc, and Season 2 filters or Serum 2 filters. In the normal section, you're going to find the bread and butter filters. These are going to be the most used filters. These are going to be the filters, for instance, the low pass that will allow you to turn a saw into a booty shaking machine. Right. Versus this, which sounds cool, but buzzy. The other thing is I don't need to remove all the highs. Remember, this is just going to be here for you know, tone shaping the sound. OK. So with the low pass, we have access to that. Now, the cutoff is going to be pretty much where the removal of the frequency starts, which with a low pass, it's allowing the lows through. So it's cutting highs. So with this, you decide where it begins. With the resonance, you can add a boost at the cutoff point where we're starting to reduce. Reasons you might want to do this is to achieve the Josh Baker sound, as I would say, or more of these squelchy like sounds. All right. OK, you do increase the resonance, but I do want to point out that when you increase the resonance, you are losing a bit of low end. You can see that here. So keep that in mind, because as you increase resonance, you lose some low end. OK, but in return, you get more of this mid-low sound, which with certain type of sounds, makes it sound more housey, gives you a different tone. You're seeing me move this drive here. Right. And as I move it up and down, what's happening? Well, the drive, all it's doing is right now with the drive down, there's a level that is being, you know, that there's a level that this square is coming into the filter. So with the drive, what this is doing, it's increasing the volume as it comes into the filter. Now, with the low pass, with analog equipment, when you would, let's say, have a drive, let's say the square is coming in and it's not hitting the ceiling yet. So with the drive, you can push that thing like, OK, to make it hit the ceiling more, which when you hit the ceiling, depending on the preamp or the amp that that certain machine you're using has, it's going to either one square it off, slowly round it off, which will produce harmonics compression, which will produce warmth, which can produce unwanted but it can also produce fattiness. From there, the fat is going to have to deal with the resonant point. Right. So we were talking about how when I increase this resonance, the low end, right, is going down because we're increasing that resonance. Well, with the fatness, I can bring it back up. Like so. There is a volume increase, don't let that fool you, but with fatness, it's going to be more on the resonant point. So similar to the drive, but it's going to be more focused on this resonance point. OK, from there to the right, we have this pan, which I believe is one of the most under used sections in Serum 2's filter range. The cool thing is I could have a mono sound. But I can create width because what's happening is I move this pan left and right, it's essentially changing the value of the cutoff for the left and right signal in order to have width on the sound, you need to have more than one voice, you need to have the sound sound slightly different on the left and the right. So with this guy here, sometimes you can grab sounds that don't have that much width and you can create that width by having the filter have different values for each one. One side has more high end than the other, and that creates the sense of width. And now it's extreme. From there, we have the mix knob. So with the mix knob here, I can control how much the filter is affecting the sound by. We're going to get into when this becomes valuable because there have been scenarios where I would want to use that, specifically more with more extreme filters. A couple of things before we move on to the next filters. In order to route sounds here, right, because we can have up to four oscillators playing at the same time, in order to route sounds here, I'd need to input and let Serum know that I want oscillator B or C to come in. So all I'm doing is clicking here when it's highlighted blue. It's telling Serum that the sound is being allowed through. From there to the right of that, we have something known as key track, which becomes very useful. The reason key track exists is because if I'm playing a low octave bass, let's say I decide to play higher up, you can barely feel or hear that. So what key track does is the higher I play on my keyboard, again, you guys can see the notes changing here. It makes it so that those high notes become more audible and more present. So usually key track for me is very useful whenever I'm creating a sound that can be played as a bass, as a lead or a sound that covers a whole range of frequency. For some bass lines, it becomes useful. So that's how we would route the sounds into here. The other thing I want to take note and point out is at the top right of our oscillator section here, there's this M, if you click there, it's going to say main. If I route that to A, you're going to see that it changes to a filter now. And now here's where you control the filter balance. We can route it to filter two, filter one, or we can have both one and two working at the same time on the same sound in parallel. OK, and in a bit, we'll get to how you can have it. So it goes into filter one and then filter two, and then it goes into the effect so we can change the signal flow as well. Low pass, really good for bass lines. OK, there's one more thing I think I need to discuss, which is this number on the right side. This number relates to what we would call a dB pole. All that is is the cutoff point here. When we use a higher number, it's more strict. And when we use a lower number, it's less strict, more highs are allowed out. To give you an example of how this matters is if I'm making a bass and I want a very warm bass, a very punchy bass, I would go with a low 24 for that because we remove more of the highs versus if I go with an 18. Right, versus 24, right, 12. That's more highs out, OK? So six, boom, boom, boom. OK, so with that, you do have the MG low 12, 6, 18, 24. And then you have these guys here, the lows, just the low. The thing that changes is the way this resonance works. So I want you to keep that in mind. So watch, if I put the resonance up, it looks like that. If I go to the MG low 24, you're going to see the changes in the curve of the resonance, the way it's being done. So that's why you have those two, right? Depending on which one you like more, the shape of, the contour of, you're going to decide to use that one more. Using analog synths teaches you is that the flavor of the filter matters. And even though when you see it in Serum 2, it's a very slight change, right? It's nothing like, whoa, that was a huge change. It still matters a ton on the type of sounds you're going to be creating. It matters because that's the character of the filter, the tonality of it. So from there, below the low pass, we have the high pass filters here. Now, this one's not going to have as many flavors because no one's ever said high passes sound delicious. High passes just remove low frequencies from the left to the right until the sound is just thin as life. Like the competition, they sound like a mosquito. I'm just kidding. OK, but they're very useful for leads, for instance, if I'm making like a Morton Garrix lead. They're also good for movement. To the bandpass, which is a more. And it's more about emphasizing a frequency. I always say the bandpass is like the low pass and high pass had a baby because low pass would be this section and the high pass would be the other section. This one is good for movement. It's also really good if we're trying to make that's why you might want to do something like this. Now, personally, I don't do it. But this is a scenario where I would use the mix, which, again, is the dry and wet for that. How much does the filter influence the sound? And from there, below that, we have a peak, which is just going to be like that bandpass, but now it's just boosting at a certain frequency. And then we have the notch, which super cool. The peak and the notch, I see them as one emphasizing or adding movement to a sound. So, for example, if I have a super saw sound. We can make something that sounds somewhat like a flanger. Essentially, the multi is combining filters and also allowing you to morph between the different filters. So the first one we have is the LH6, L stands for low, H stands for high pass and six stands for the DB pole we talked about. How strict are the cuts? These filters are really good for tone shaping and for adding movement. Now, this knob here change, as you can see for the drive stays the same, but this goes from frequency to fat. So I believe the frequency here is controlling the high pass and the cutoff point is controlling the low pass. And then you have the resonance points here. From there, this is just going to be the same, but the DB pulls higher. Resonance matters more. And then we have more here, the LB12, which is low pass and bandpass together. Frequency looks like it's controlling. This is a hard one to cut off, controls the low pass and frequency controls the bandpass. So again, this is a very interesting curve. Again, these are cool because a lot of the times with sound design, one part that many people miss is the frequency. A lot of people think sound design is just messing with these. But in the mixing side of stuff, there is a part of sound design that has to relate to the EQ, the way you're boosting the sound, because sometimes you need to boost like crazy on a certain part to get the sound you want. Here we have a low pass and a peak, 12. The peak is here. This one I might use for a bass where I want to add some movement somewhere in the frequencies. Notice how I guess the key track, I just noticed this, that only the cutoff one moves, but not the frequency here. If you wanted this one to move, you can easily route this modulation there. We're getting a little ahead of ourselves here, but I feel it's nice to note. We have these guys down here. Now, this is where the game changes a bit because these guys are morphable. What that means is, if you remember, I said that the band pass is a baby of the low pass and the high pass. So in between this morph, we can morph between the filters like this. Boom, boom. This becomes useful again for movement on the sound. Like a pad. Imagine now the cutoff moving as well, and that's where these become useful. So you're going to have different dB pulse for these. You have a low pass, band pass, high pass, low pass, peak, high pass, low pass, notch, high pass, low pass, notch, high pass, 24, which again just makes it stricter. And then the peak and notch. OK, below that we have the flange section, which this section there's a lot to talk about. And as you can see, you have various different variations. And all I want you to think with these guys is extreme boost and extreme removal of frequency, which leads to more interesting tones in a sound that you don't get power, but it sounds more interesting. These are good for drum and bass, dubstep, some tech house, some techno sound design for botanical based sounds and sounds that sound kind of like you're in a greenhouse. Anytime you just want to add something interesting to the sound. But the key thing I want you to know with these is that you always will lose power and you will always you will always lose a bit of presence. But in return, what you get is that interesting tone to the sound. Combs are just going to be notches and boosts. So notch is the decreasement and the boost. When you do this, you're altering the phase around those cuts, and this is showing us here the phase. So like if I move it, you can see. OK. So there's a lot going on with a comb, but what it gives you access to. And I can also key track it. This is what key track matters a ton now, because if I want some form of tone. That's sick. And then we're going to have a comb. Oh, sick. So now this becomes usable LP frequency, which is the low pass for these combs. And the resonance controls those peaks and notches. Flange again, very similar, but mimicking a flange effect. Paris Hilton's favorite filter, I would say. If you guys know, you know, and if you don't know, you must be young. So enjoy your youth. Now, the reason I like these filters is because sometimes I want to provide a flange effect to a sound I'm creating for someone, but the problem is with the flange effect inside of Serum. Well, this is kind of very uninspiring. I can't see any form of visual response. The thing with flange, it's static flange is also sick because sometimes let's say I'm here. Right. And I like that and I don't want it to move. So there you go. I can key track. OK. Resonance again is controlling these notches. So you can see I'm adding that. OK, from there we have the phase filters, which very similar to the notch. The big thing with the phasers is they're not as crazy. And I love using them on sounds to add movement, but also I feel like the phaser adds more of that tone without the craziness of a flange and comb. For example, let's just do one. OK, and then we can add another one, minus 36. OK, movement, you get the... All right. So from there, we're going to have variations to the phaser. How many notches do we have? How many reducements? How? That's what these are for. Then we have the high pass one, HP here. Then we have formant phasers, which is going to be at the bottom. F, P, H, S. Or it might be flanger phaser. It's a combination of both. Move that like that for wubs as we get into it. From there, we get into the mix section of Serum 2, where we have a low EQ, low EQ 12, band EQ, high EQ, EQ. These are just going to be like EQs, almost. And, you know, I always explain filters to people like they're essentially EQs, which in reality, if you think about it, they are. So that's what these are. They're EQs, band EQ to remove or add. But remember, any boost or reducement can always provide movement if you move left to right. You know, with Ring Mob for me, at low values, we get this vibrato tremolo like effect. But then as we start to go up slowly. We start to get more of a tonal change. The way I like to think of Ring Mob is for adding an interesting tone to a sound or for creating these kind of sounds. R2D2. Because remember, we do have this mix knob. So if I ever have a sound like a sine, I want to add this. But as a layer, I can move my mix. Here. I can add key track. The manager just states a second Ring Mob is being added and the spread controls the distance between both the frequencies. So if you notice in the first one, we can control the cutoff here like so. So with Ring Mob X2, we're controlling the spread of the first one and the second one. So. Again. From there, we have a sample and hold, which is a bit crushing effect. I really like it, especially for this Josh Baker, Chris Stussy stuff. You can quantize it, which just means square it off and get this cool, like, crush effect on the sound. Sample and hold minus is going to give us the difference between the sample and hold distortion and the input signal. So the way to explain the reverb, all pass and combs, the main thing with all three of them is that they essentially smear the sound. So. Strong saw could be a good bass one day, but this makes it sound smeared almost like someone put a very low size reverb on it at a hundred percent and you're hearing the output of that. Damp dampens the feedback so if you notice this sounds like it has a sound that's ringing out a lot. As I increase the damp you can feel that it tightens up a lot more and you start to hear less of that effect like that reverb low room and more more detailed sound. Okay so you can see right we are losing a lot of fatness and forwardness in exchange for that tonality which I can always try and mitigate by going half. This one on my pan. So that way down the center we have the nice saw and on the sides we have the nice layer that's more textural. These kind of sounds almost like metallic transformer like because watch if I do this and this. Alright and then just give you guys like a quick little preview of what you're able to do in the future episodes. You can do I can add this layer to the sound and that's what they would be useful for. From there as we move down we have a French low-pass and a German low-pass. Whenever I use them is when it's pretty much whenever I will need a different flavored kind of filter because if you see this low-pass has a boost here with a little bit of a reducement here and then it's a weird shape to it but that alters the tone of whatever you run through it. And also as I move the cutoff from the left to the right it sounds more squelchy compared to the others so that's where I might decide to use this over the others. From there we have an add bass which Sarah Manuel states phase rotated low-pass filter with a touch of drive. Again very unnatural but like Steve says maybe we'll find use for it. The way I categorize that is like me using this but the mix at around like 81. As we go down we get into some other bomb filters that I really like the formants. Formant filters are great for adding vocal like qualities to a sound like a a yo a yo oh yo what's up my homie you know kind of vibe. They're really cool for that. Watch I have a saw and I'm gonna play the saw really deep like bass and as I move the cutoff you can hear the a yo a yo resonance will boost or reduce on everything except the resonances that give that vocal like quality to this formant filter. I'm gonna increase the drive. At low volumes they sound bomb. At higher values and then here we have this formant of filter one variation which the way I see it it alters where the frequencies of formants are at. Okay so for instance in two we shift it to the right more and I believe in one it's the same thing. We add a different flavor. From there we have a band reject filter which is the opposite of a band pass. Pretty much yeah we're getting this new flavor because of the way we're manipulating the frequency in a way where you wouldn't even think to do right because it's like what who would want to chop off the mids out of a sound but it's the opposite of a band pass and with the width you control the width of the reducement and the resonance you can add resonance on the left and right side to create the devil's horns. The next frequency set we have are the comb low pass band pass and comb two. So comb one is gonna be a positive comb filter so think of the phase just being different when the negative it's low or a positive it's gonna be more up right above. So with this one you have a low pass you have a drive and then you have the resonance and then you have where the comb filter frequencies are going to be applied and the difference between the LP and BP obviously is instead of a low pass we're using a band pass and then the two is just an inverted negative comb which just changes the tonality of it that's the best way to put it. You know screen filters for me are sick whenever I'm trying to create heavily distorted sounds with this screech like quality to it so cut off it's just a low pass resonance up but the magic of this happens when the drive starts going above a certain amount and you set your scream to alter the tone very prodigy like I would say so high resonance high I'm gonna have it key track if I want this to also move I can add this note which is similar to the key track which is gonna again move this depending on where I'm playing season two filters and I say like fortnight but just serum to the new serum two filters these ones we have the wasps which what WSB I think it's the wasps there's a synth called the wasps which has a very interesting filter which I believe this is trying to mimic okay then we do have a morph where you can morph between a high pass a notch and that low pass the way I use that more sometimes is I'll probably bring in something like this so that way there's always this high end to the bass or sound but I still get the feeling of a low pass moving left and right or notch key thing with this filter the preamp of it notice there there is some reducement on the low end here so let's keep that in mind when you use it but I love the way this one sounds with a good bass square sound a little bit of this guy up you can hear there's this grittiness on the top that's one thing I learned from having one of these synths over here the Dave's the ob6 from Dave Smith and it's and shows a collab between these two great synth legends love the synth and it's where I learned that I can have a low pass like this but the more can be a little up so you allow that rainy top end to it have a DJ mixer which left right low pass high pass I guess it's supposed to sound like a DJM filter we're gonna have a diffuser it makes stuff sound phasing kind of blurry grab our stages but it has this effect like if you're making the new tech house stuff like the electro tech it has that sound that you probably seeking this one we have an mg ladder filter which I believe it's gonna stand for a Moog filter this smooth works because when I move this left and right it's smoother it's not as it's not gonna be as bitey when you use an envelope to shape acid stuff ladder filter again it's just the way that resonance is boosted in the way it sounds you can already see the rest is a lot different pain the next filter we have is known as PC SPF which I just want you to think you can draw in your filters okay essentially you can create almost like your own filter wavetable for example I want to remove some lows so now I can draw the filter but now I can go to two let me just put in some presets which you can find here there's a and then number four let's add like I don't know your way there we go boom the reason we do that is because now we can switch between all the different filters we've programmed or created ourselves and God yeah yeah be careful or the volume because this thing it's just not it's not optimized so pretty much you can like move between different filters it looks like and also modulate between them from there we have come to it's just another variation of the cone filter but in the serum manual it does state it's crazier which sure crazy stuff there you go again boost the notches yeah sure from there we have EXP mm which is gonna I believe go between filters and just to quote the manual multi-mode LPF notch HPF output from the classic synthesizer expander module whatever that means the last thing to note is that as you saw me doing right-click here I can right-click between different modes to see what the filter does to the sound so remember anytime you cut like this right like people will tell you oh you can't do harsh cuts because the more harsher the cut is the more brick wall the more steep the more it's gonna affect the phases around so with this you can see how the face is affected let's see if you highlight this filter grab but you can all click to switch between the modes I rarely use it maybe I'll do something like this to see the frequency how it's altering but other than that just leave it here need it okay okay so we'll make a couple of sounds and I'll teach you guys how you can program this okay so I'm just gonna go into the digital section let's pick something no oh my god what was that let's go higher up sure let's do something like this okay and now let's say that and filter one I'm gonna route this guy so now I can click here and I can route between them right so I can do parallel so why don't we do that just for fun I don't know what we're making here all I know is we're making a pad so we're gonna follow that now both filters are working right see they're in parallel which means they're both gonna go directly to the master they're not going into each other which is good you know we don't want no babies but from there let's say I'm one foot on one side I want I don't know like a flange so we do that and then on filter two maybe we'll do like like instead of a flange let's just do a phaser now we have that if I can only run one filter it would sound like this too but now in the middle I get both let's say here that I want to remove the low end out of some of the oscillators but not out of the main one and I don't want to use the system of this guy here because I'm gonna be using my warps or something right this is how we would do it so if you go into the mix the mix is gonna show you the mixer module inside of serum 2 okay we activate the filters you're gonna see in the mix here you're gonna have this button here what this is gonna do is it's gonna pretty much allow you to mess with the signal flow of how stuff works right now both of these are going to the main that means they're both going here into this effects chain which you find here main boom however if I want it to go like into each other first so serial right there they're gonna be altering each other then I can send either filter 1 or filter 2 to the other filter so I can send this to 2 so now if I turn this off you're gonna hear that you know filter 2 is still removing the highs versus before I send it to the main right like you can see filter 2 doesn't do anything don't think so now here I can route it to filter 2 so now the sound this guy only have it going to filter 1 right now it's gonna go from here to the filter 1 to filter 2 so the way this is useful is let's say that I'll give you guys a good like practical example of where I would do it a lot of times you know I'm looking at creating unique basses because you know I've been doing this professionally now for about 10 to 12 years I forget if it was 2014 when I started but but yeah it's it's about I would say 11 years actually so you know it gets boring to make saw basses and square basses constantly for people so I've been trying to find ways that I can make more unique basses but still have the fatness and the reason why the square and saw basses always work so what I will do is I will go into spectral I will find a good bass a good tone so I'm gonna turn this first filter into a high pass or to remove the low ends out of this guy okay so we have this and then this filter 2 is there so I'm just gonna route this guy to filter 1 to remove some low end let's say I like this I think that's a sick tone very unique for a bass but now I need to have a low end because this I can let it have low end but the problem with a lot of these bass lines is they're flawed because they sound interesting in tone but they lack the low end power so I'll use the high pass here and then it's filter 2 I'll use the low pass like this but now I need to have a fat sound right so that's where I would use a saw or square but now I'm gonna click here filter and I'm gonna route this one to only filter 2 so it doesn't get the high end cut so okay so now the saw is going into filter 2 only I'm gonna use a low 18 resonance now here I am gonna use this filter because I have no other option I can't really control the top part of the saw and the reason I'm controlling it is because I want the tonality of this guy to control the high end not the soft top so the saw will still provide that fatness I'm gonna use this guy boom see here we lose the effect but now we gain it back and we have the fatness of the saw if I wanted to I can bring in another sound into filter 1 I'm gonna move this a little to the left and with it I have to bring something new to the table so right now this sound is very monophonic everything's down the center so if I wanted to bring in another layer to the sound I would bring in something wide I'm gonna use that first filter to remove like so Let's add a bit of reverb. Let's put through that zero. That wide one now is adding this really interesting tone. And there we go. So filter 2, filter 1. The other alternative to this might be that filter 1 I want to do like a flange of sorts. Like something interesting, then I can do that. And now only the sounds going into filter 1 get it. Let's add a warp. Let's see if we can bring in something interesting. For this, I'll go with a square because there's a cool sound we can create with filters now. Use just one filter. And we're going to use... Put it in the right spot. Okay, we got that. And now we can play with the wasp. You can also switch this to add seconds to make a deep bass. And then we can go through them all as well. Let's make one more. I feel like I'm copping out here. Let's make it hard. I know a lot of you guys make tech house, so that's why I'm sticking to those sounds. So let's say filter 1, I have a nice little low pass, we're going to go 6 so that way the overtones on the saw come out, but we still get that nice housey vibe because the highs are being reduced a bit. Now in filter 2, ok so filter 1 I'm going to route it to filter 2, I like doing it this way you can also do it by clicking here. Filter 2, I'm going to use a sample and hold. Now we make these nice sounds and then. High resonance. Ok. There we go and then the. Key track it. And there we go we have another sick sound. So those are filters ok, so just in review, filters are tools that you're going to use to manipulate the frequency to either emphasize a certain part, to add movement, to add character, to add warmth, to add brightness to a sound. Filters are probably one of the biggest backbones of sound design, probably one of the most important things and each filter is different, you know, don't get caught in the trap of every low pass filter is the same, it's not, there's a reason why you see your favorite producers use specific synths, right, for instance if you see a lot of the UK house guys are using more Roland stuff, right, the filters on Roland stuff are a little bit more like bright, have a specific sound which leads the sauce to sound a certain way a lot easier than it is to use a Moog because Moog filters tend to be a lot warmer and they have a different response to the way that squelch sounds, the resonant we were playing, so keep that in mind, ok, because it is super important. We went through all the filters, again, if you need just a few to kind of like work on, practice on for homework, low pass, high pass, band pass, notch, from there at least one phase, one flange filter, one comb filter, sample and hold, and the ring mod, those are going to be like the main ones I would say you learn and from there everything else we'll build on it or just variations to those, but with that being said guys you're ready now, go make some sounds, don't just watch the video and say I'm done, make a couple of sounds, have fun with it, you know, cement the knowledge and I'll see you guys next time for another video, took the weekend off for this series but I hope to do a video a day until we're done, so with that being said you guys take care and you guys have a great rest of your day, much love, my filter experts.",
