    "text": "Deep house is one of those genres that you appreciate as you grow older, so today we are going to make a deep house like Pyrrhos, like this. When it comes to deep house, there are many ways to do it, and to be honest, I like each one of them, but today I want to do the cream and butter version deep house, like we will have a vocal, we will track around it, and play for the vibes. When I start, I always start with at least a chord progression type of thing, but starting with the kick and bass progression really helps a lot, so we will start like that. For the kick, I like smooth kicks, I have a whole pack about it, but pick something like this. It is a mid-long kick, and we are gonna actually brighten up slightly, right? Depending on the bass actually, you can shorten it a bit more, but we will see about that. And for the deep house, I really like this like kick-thumb type of groove. The way I like to do it, just take your kick sample, shorten it out, keep it short, and then just use an EQ to take like this mid-low part of the sound, so that you have this like warm sound, but still transient enough, so that it can pop in the mix. The placement doesn't matter, I prefer to put them on the off-beat, like this. You can build any pattern you like. For the bass, I like this kind of perfect fifth layered bass sounds a lot in deep house. I think it gives a whole ton of a vibe. We are in the D sharp minor, so let's start with eight bass, but that means there's just eight basses in a bar. It's not a rolling bass, so it will give more like a smoother feeling. So we have this now. So it is kind of a big sound, but let me explain a bit more. So the sound wise, if I turn these two off, we will just have ours up. This gives this up, so this is the reason that the sound will be relatively stable, but that harmonic feel on the sound comes from these two. If I solo this one, this is like one octave up, and this is in the same octave. So what happens is, we are using sync to get those upper harmonics, the power harmonics of the sound, like here. Let me just solo these two, so you can actually hear the effect of only one note sound. Right? And here around, and then we do the same thing over here. Let me turn this off, so you can hear this. This is much higher, and this gives that this signature deep house bass sound. Listen to this now. If we go to effects, we have a distortion, chorus, combo, hyperdynamic. This is coming from my silk preset pack. There is really, really, really nice deep house basses there. And another important thing is that we have the soft envelope on cutoff. And also the volume envelope has this slight decay. So we have this really strong sound, right? This is the core of the sound. We have of course on unison on top layers to open up the sound on the sides. But sound is a bit stereo too. And then from there we want to open up space for the kick. So I'm using DAC for it. You can use any sidechain tool that you like. Now the main reason I'm using Saturn here is not really that much of distortion, but pushing those upper harmonics up. You see this is pulled up around 4 dB. So these like mid highs. Right? This really pushes that feel. And we are on the linear phase to keep the And finally you could even more boosting. This is a signature deep house bass. This is like everywhere. And I love this sound for it. Now I like to layer this with another higher bass layer. The way I like to use that oftentimes in deep house is actually start with the simple bass layer and then an additional high layer with the verses and choruses to add a bit dimension to the bass itself. The way we are going to do it actually taking exactly the same sound but removing this sub and put this one octave above. So we have now this. Right? And together this turn into this. And then you always control how much you will add that upper layer with just mixing. It can become a bit too much when the bass is alone. But when the layers comes in, the percussions, the kicks, or the snares, the vocals, you will hear how much difference this can make. Now when it comes to bass, what I like to do, I need kind of a bass progression to kind of at least inspire me or something. If you feel like you're gonna try this, please consider like and subscribe so I can show you more of these. Let's start with the classic 6-4-0. Meaning that if we take a look at our root key, D sharp. Six means that six, not a bow. Like one, two, three, four, five, six. And then you go to fourth. And then you go back to the root. This will create this kind of decreasing tension, relaxing feeling. It's a very deep house thing. Right? Now we have this. With the kick. That immediate burst of deep house feeling. Now when I make this type of tracks, the tracks has to evolve around the vocals. Hence I like to bring the vocals as early as possible. You can either use the samples from Splice, your vocalist friends, AI, whatever you like. In this case, I want Splice hunting and found this. That's it. And I think for a deep house track, you oftentimes don't even need more than this. Because you want repetition and you want hookiness. And this is very hooky vocal. Maybe on the breakdown you can use some ad-libs. But for me, for this type of tracks, this is really good. The only thing that I don't like, and this is a very common producer pitfall, is like producers will put like this. For me, it is so obvious. Like the vocal is actually recorded as it is. But I think the beat should come after the first bar like this. Do you hear it? It is so obvious. At least for me. So when you are picking vocals, like try to really listen where the beat should sink into the vocal. Like when you do this, you are elevating that. I cannot stress this enough. Like when I say this, really try to really pay attention. You're a composer and your job is to elevate the elements that you are using. Especially the main elements. In this type of tracks, the vocals. I know a lot of producers think that they are producers. They have to find the best leads or sounds. No. As a producer, your job is, when you have the vocals like this, is to elevate the main theme as much as possible. Right? And for me, this. That down in it, drown in it. It is the thing. It is the hook. So how we can elevate? Of course, just move that. And this immediately gives me an idea. Because now I'm thinking, oh wait, this could be an extremely good intro. Why? Because let's move this a bit more here now. And then I can bring immediately, forget that kick, bring that bass in. So like this. Oh my god, immediately, right? Now, when you have ideas like this, and hopefully you will have it, when you find the right things and you get into the right flow, it will click like this. You will like, oh that or this and that. And arrangement resolves itself. That gives me immediately, I want to build that intro now. Because now I can make a really catchy intro to grab attention of my listeners. Now I have the things that I need to have. What I need though, create the ambience to give that deep house, that deep ethereal ambience for the listeners. But the first thing I think is, of course, the pads. Let's bring those pads. Let's create pads. I really feel like organic sounds, like guitars, or guitar-like sounds, or like organ-like sounds. Like the sounds that you would hear it in organic music, really adds a depth and layer for this genre. So this preset that I found, again coming from Silk Preset Pack. I cannot stress enough, this is one of the best packs you can find for mediuc house and deep house. The idea is like simple, finding this kind of organic sound. This was by the way another spectral, but I was just scrolling through, just find more guitar-like sounds. So we have this. This is just only thing that I changed in this patch. So we are holding that guitar sound, and adding bunch of effects, to create this really deep, haunting ambience. And a bit EQ, cut that super lows out. So it's more like even drone, and then sidechain the kick, slightly. Gorgeous, really gorgeous. Now, what it hits me, is like, oh my god, my vocal is dry. I want this big deep house vocals on top. Before I do that, I'm gonna make one more pad, because I know when the vocals comes in, it will take too much space. Creating this simple elegant sounds under it, it's harder when you have big vocals. So let's get another string-like pad here. And remember, I'm just playing one single note, and it is the root key, D sharp. We can also sometimes play the fifth, third. But now, I think to make the focus on the vocals, this is more than enough. And we have this sound now. Again, of course, you know it coming from Silk. This is more like a, more airy, more like stringy, maybe the vocally, so together they are like this. Right? And this in turns into this. Is it enough? No, because we need to work on our vocal now. The deep house vocal standard is this airy, beautiful, what is the right word for this? Like a majestic, right? Majestic is the right word. So how do we do this? We have a single vocal, we don't have any extra take, so we need to create everything from single vocals. You can use AI, I have videos about that. But I'm gonna do it the old school way now. I'm gonna start with the timeless. I know it's very like a big and interfering a bit with the main vocal. To decrease that, we are ducking a little bit. This is the timeless own feature. Otherwise, we have to put a sidechain compression on top of itself, so that it ducks the effect when the vocal comes in. And then we can have a huge reverb. I'm using a vintage reverb. I like the way you're going down. This classic long tail reverb right on top of the vocal. Now we have these really airy vocals here. And I want to dump a little bit here. The support is, we are gonna actually duplicate the same vocals. But we are going to use chorus as introducing that slight pitch shift and pushing the sound to the side, so that there is a depth and full listeners. There are more than one vocals, but simply the same vocals. We are using chorus D. I like this one because I think this works really well on vocals and 100% with. Now we have this. Vocal really pushed to the sides. And now when it comes to the effects, it really depends on what you want. You can really use it as dry as well, because we blend them. I like the way you're going down. With that. It's really good, isn't it? That's the reason I really like that specific plugin from R3. It just works amazing, depending on your feel, depending on how it sounds in your track. You can add even those sides a bit of reverb. The main thing I like to do oftentimes, intro is a bit of overdrive. So glue those two vocals into each other. This is something that we are going to show later. And let's see how it sounds, right? Again, don't use too much effects if it doesn't need it. Let's listen. I like the way you're going down. Now our work with the vocal doesn't end here. So I'm immediately feeling like I don't like this part coming again. I want to hold that down in it, around in it, that part longer. So we're part. Right. Hold that going going here. Right, there you go. The track build. This one, I mean, this type of tracks really builds themselves and there's really kind of joy to make them. But I'm feeling like now, when the second part comes in here. Here's the part that we start to build a bit with maybe percussions, like making that change. You can put simple hats here. Again, eight hats. We don't need to rush anything like this. Shaper box adds this dirt on it. Without it. With. A bit EQ. And finally duck. Really slightly to making a bit more on beat, off beat feeling a bit more obvious. Slightly ducking here, right? I want kind of this like organic percussion style sound on top of this too. So in title of rip sound. So we have this. I want to clip a bit slightly. Remove that love and mud. And do the same thing over here. Adding a bit noise on top. So it sounds more organic. Distorted. Clip one more time. And regain. Now we have this. And then I actually like to build a verse. We can just duplicate what we have like this, right? And remove these vocals. I think we can layer the hats a bit more. Like a 16 type of hats on top. But just following that kind of sound. Rather than just straight 16. But it adds to the groove. And we make ad-libs from the vocals. Like take those vocals, copy them here. Right? And then because the vocals are so strong, we want to like get this, build this verse, get into the vocal and then get into the maybe arpeggio or something like that. So what you can do, duplicate this one, put in the vocals and then duplicate one more and build and delete. So we are kind of ABing stuff around. That means that now we have here. Remember that when we do have those switch or turnaround points, be kind of like, I like to remove the kick set this in some parts. It may be double kick over here. Right? And high passing the low end in parts. So that turnaround gets a bit stronger. Also you would like to support them with the transition effects. Like here, I'm already feeling like at the entry here, we can probably put some like a white noise, reverse cymbal. So things like this, right here when the vocal comes in, reverse cymbal coming from my FX pack and then like a downshift there. So it is more like emphasized. Right? And kind of a build up here with the reverse. Again, everything coming from my FX pack. To be honest, this downlift is maybe too much, but it's also a bit genre thing. It is used widely. The final touch is actually now building kind of the secondary hook. Secondary hook in deep houses oftentimes something almost as strong as vocals, but that will carry the track. Especially if you go for like pop stylish arrangement. So you have this AB sections where the hook changes or they are like two separate hooks that can actually keep people listening. The reason for this that in pop music, you really want to keep people engaged all the time. In electronic dance music, we have more relaxed arrangement. And deep house, especially if you go for this vocal direction, I feel like it really enjoys that pop-ish arrangement style. If you want to keep people a bit more engaged. So for me, you can use anything, but I like synthesizers. I'm a sound designer. So my idea over here is, what if we go for like a chords. I enjoy also this kind of happy chords. What you do now is actually take that chord progression that we have, right? And go for this dotted progression. Like here what we are doing basically, we are using same progression, but adding the second note. Here the fifth, fifth, fifth. And at the end of the turnaround, just introduce something else to add a bit drama. So how does this sound? This sounds like this. Right? It's like a very deep house. Like this is something you would hear a lot. For the sound wise, I'm just leaving a couple of different presets. You can either go for this kind of more fuller sound. Let me show the other one first as well. This type of more gentle sounds as well. This will work too. Let me play it for you. Right? But for this one, I'm a more bigger sound girl. So I like a bit bigger sounds. Main idea is this. Right? It's kind of like a super sobby, short pluck sound on top of high plucky sound. And one ambient style sound. So together they create this kind of really cool, full sound. And we have duck on it to sidechain the kick. And a big vintage reverb. Creating this washed out. Because we had this vocal with the big wash out, and we giving up the same vibe here too. And this really switch up the vibes a lot. If you especially support this was kind of build up. Kind of really natural builds up into the sound. As usual, this is available on my Patreon. If you want to go deeper and really study everything, feel free to go check out there. Unfortunately, we removed the supply sound. Because I don't have rights to distribute that. But the rest will be there. If you have supplies, you can download the same vocal and just put it there. And you will have it. Okay? Now we learned that you can take a look at here. This is also cool.",
