================================================================================

[00:00] The black friday is almost here and you want to know what to buy and what to skip,

[00:04] this is a classic in this channel, a black friday plugin tier list, to help exactly with that,

[00:09] I have simple three rules, quality, discount amount and discount frequency,

[00:14] but in the end my personal opinions will decide which tier plugins get,

[00:19] and you may disagree, last year we had beautiful discussions,

[00:23] many commented on the opinions, their own S tier plugins and discounts,

[00:27] so I really encourage you to share your opinions below on the comment section,

[00:32] it is still early in black friday so I will miss probably some plugin deals,

[00:36] so I would also appreciate putting those on the comment section so other people can see,

[00:40] enough with the words, so let's jump in and roll some plugins.

[00:45] I did my homework, we have a lot to go through, and the first one on the list is all this spicy,

[00:51] and a deal they have on their website is buy two get two plugins,

[00:55] on top of that they have individual plugin discounts too, for example I like their

[01:00] situations, we see that they have somewhere between like 50, 60, 40, 30 depending on the

[01:05] plugin itself, discounts looks alright, combining with two to four, I think we are getting good

[01:11] prices, the only issue is that initial prices are quite high, 50% discount makes them still

[01:18] around like 100 euros, so it's still kind of expensive, so because of that I'm gonna put them

[01:24] into like a late A tier, again I don't have any problems with their quality, good sounding plugins,

[01:30] the price is starting to be too high, but discounts are not bad, oh yeah,

[01:34] autotune, if you have been following my channels I have a war against the pricing of the autotune

[01:41] plugins, be it Melodyne or Antares autotune, you may wonder what I mean by that, black friday,

[01:47] early bird, special deals up to 60% off, sounds great, and the one that many people will use,

[01:54] this one, autotune unlimited subscription, so their flagship autotune plugin, it is great,

[01:59] I use it all the time, if you now go to subscribe, 145 danish crowns per month,

[02:06] with 60% discount, so this is the discounted price for the subscription, and I have no idea

[02:12] why I'm getting Danish crowns, hello I'm in Sweden, around 20 euros, with 60% discount,

[02:18] I repeat 20 euros monthly with 60% discount, for me these prices are, I don't know, it's crazy,

[02:27] it's just autotune plugin, like I know there you get other things, but come again, we are really

[02:33] going for the autotune main with this plugin, so you are paying 20 euros per month for just

[02:38] autotune plugin, so yearly 240 euros, yearly, 240 euros, in two years you're almost paying

[02:46] as much as you paid for the Ableton, it is ridiculous, I don't have anything about the

[02:51] quality, but this is really ripping the customer off, so I'm really pissed off, because of that,

[02:58] Melodyne is the same, I'm gonna put it like B, even after 60% you are still paying insane amount

[03:05] of money, so I protest, the next one is actually relatively easier, Arturia effects bundle,

[03:11] currently Arturia have 50% discount with their effects bundle, I use many things here,

[03:16] I think they all sound great, you are getting how many, so many, oh wait 18 here, another 20 here,

[03:23] I don't know, let's be honest, this already covers most of your effects needs, and for 259,

[03:29] you are getting like 10 euros per plugin right, I think it's a straightforward for me, simple as

[03:34] tear, Sonarworks come up with this really cool product, sound ID, voice ID, it translates your

[03:41] voice or anything really into your vocals or different instruments as well, you get to choose

[03:47] from different factory presets, I think Maya sounds good, and to make it really obvious,

[03:57] I'm gonna record my own voice now, so Maya now re-sings it for me,

[04:04] Maya will save my treble vocals, cool isn't it, other cool thing that you can do,

[04:12] record anything that you like,

[04:16] convert it to an instrument, maybe a drum,

[04:21] found some supplies, lift me up, make me feel like I'm the only one, this vocal needs a bit

[04:34] from here, lift me up to here, lift me up, make me feel like I'm the only one,

[04:42] and if you want to try it, check the links below, this also brings us the Arturia V collection,

[04:46] again have 50% discount, this time it's 340, look at this, this is just insane,

[04:52] like how many different synthesizers that you are getting, for me it's a no-brainer,

[04:57] it's one of those plugin bundles that you buy once and use for many years, the good thing is that you

[05:02] even get a better price if you own an Arturia plugin, good job Arturia, I appreciate what you

[05:07] are doing for the community, the next one is Pro Tools, and they say up to 40% off,

[05:12] they have different tiers, again yearly 353 is normally a cheap product, I think it's still a

[05:19] bit on the higher, more expensive end of the things, do I like Pro Tools and Workflow? I

[05:24] personally don't, but that doesn't matter because everybody is different, it will still be around

[05:28] like A, because it's a good discount regardless, the next is Baby Audio, they have different sales

[05:34] for different products, I really like this one actually, it's like a vocoder, vocal transformer,

[05:39] tuner, 50%, it's a nice discount, complete bundle, around 250 euros from 300, alright discount,

[05:46] individual products get discounted even more, but for example even for the humanoid, even I really

[05:51] like them, I think 660 euro is not that cheap, I will because of that like a go for late A tier,

[05:57] early B tier, somewhere around here right, it's alright, they are good sounding products too,

[06:01] that's the important part, the next one on the list is Captain Plugins, I will evaluate the mixing

[06:06] key separately, so now we are talking about more like Captain Plugins Epic, they have around 50%,

[06:12] it's like 40 euros, tools to generate beat, melody, chorus, it's very useful tool, especially if you

[06:19] need a bit more help with your theory, it really helps to go, good price, I'm gonna put it on the

[06:24] B, very early B, but it could be very well A too, the next one on the list, something that I never

[06:29] used myself, but I heard positive things about it from other producers, so take this one with a grain

[06:35] of salt, they have Cradle Everything Bundle and Beyond Super Analog, the one that I often hear

[06:41] positive things is actually the Gut Particle, originally it cost around 119, currently 83 dollars,

[06:48] EQ Plugin together 142 and Everything Bundle 427, now this is expensive isn't it, for the amount of

[06:55] things that you are getting, be free to comment below and what you think about discount, but I

[06:59] assume they don't go too much on the discount, but the discount itself is not that big, plugins

[07:04] itself starts also relatively high price, so I will probably assume like high A, early B, somewhere

[07:09] around here, let me take a sip of my coffee, the next one on the list is D16, the first thing I

[07:17] appreciate when you come into your website, it is very obvious what they are doing, 50% everything,

[07:21] simple, good job D16, I appreciate that you make it super clean for us, I think their plugins sound

[07:27] great, let's see how many total bundle 259, how many plugins do you get, alright, quite a bit,

[07:34] all their effects is all their synthesizers, 249, it is a good deal, because you get a bit more with

[07:40] the Arturia, I'm gonna compare to that, for me this is a almost a S tier, but simply because competition

[07:45] is very high, I'm gonna put it in very early A tier, this one, the Deniz Audio, thank you Deniz,

[07:51] making it clear, 50% for their total bundle, the first time I used them was the Perfect Plate,

[07:56] it was a great sounding plate, Reverb, how many, 4, 12, 14 different plugins with the bundle, 419,

[08:03] I think that's pretty good, because of that I'm gonna give them, right after D16 here, good price,

[08:08] Devious Machines, they are the maker of one of my favorite plugin, Infiltrator, and they have 20%

[08:13] of each plugins, and their bundle as well, 45% looks to be, so 25% is not that much for a Black

[08:21] Friday sale, I know we are kind of a bit spoiled, with all this 40, 50, 60% discounts, however their

[08:28] plugins don't go to discount that often, and moreover good sounding plugins, so early B,

[08:35] just because 25% could be still 30, but, but, but, but, I have to put something here too, right,

[08:43] Eventide, they are the OG FX producers, both for the hardware and software, and I personally

[08:50] enjoy their plugins quite a lot, there are a couple of plugins that I think they are very unique,

[08:55] like their Split EQ, now when I click, I don't see any discount, but I know they do have Black

[09:01] Friday, let's go to plugins, here we go, Newfangled Audio, up to 60%, they sound great as well,

[09:07] Signature FX, 80%, 89, Super Classics, the Black Hole 440, all these classics are very cheap,

[09:15] I will say, and you can bundle them for 200, this is a really good deal, and subscription,

[09:20] and look at this, like you can get subscription for Eventide plugins, you get so many different

[09:25] things for 20 dollars, and Antares, 60% discount, 20 euro, even more expensive than this, that's

[09:33] what I'm saying, my rage against these autotune plugin providers won't end, okay, where do we put

[09:40] this, I'm not even sure if this is a Black Friday deals or just deals, I think overall you can easily

[09:45] put it in the late A, the next one is FL Studio, oh my, FL Studio has 30% discount, the one thing

[09:54] about FL Studio is you buy it once, and you get lifetime upgrades, workflow is not for me,

[10:01] but it doesn't mean that other people enjoy this type of workflow, I'm gonna put them actually in

[10:06] the S tier because of that, the next one is GeForce, and it says up to 55%, they are known for their

[10:13] emulations, 9 different synthesizers I suppose, nothing against their sound, but the price wise,

[10:18] more than 400, so we see here 373, 423 euros for their bundle, so for me unfortunately the price is

[10:26] way too high, considering the alternatives that we have in the market, so for me this doesn't make

[10:32] it to S or A tier, so hence we are gonna put it somewhere around here, the next one is Mercurial

[10:40] Tones, of course I have to do my shameless plug here, we have up to 40% discount, if you get one

[10:45] 25, if you get two 40%, you can actually combine any products, I wanted to do this because people

[10:51] like to combine different things into different packs themselves, so I want to give them freedom,

[10:55] if you haven't tried, if you are looking for samples and preset packs, these are my samples

[11:00] and preset packs, and even courses are here, I have different course depending on what you are

[11:04] looking for, so if you are looking to buy anything from me, this is for your time to try them out,

[11:09] and of course my very unbiased opinion, Mercurial Tones, S tier, very unbiased opinion, very objective,

[11:18] next on the list is Sound Theory, let me come clean, Crafter is my favorite clipper, I always say it,

[11:23] it is genius, I think it sounds great, I think the price is a bit high, and I don't think it's too

[11:28] much for giving what you get, 1000 crowns like 90, 95 euros, now it's 45 euros, which is actually

[11:35] pretty good for this, and then Gullfoss from 118, 90 euros to 90 euros probably, overall 50% discount

[11:42] on both, it's great, the starting price is a bit high, not that great, so you know what's coming,

[11:48] go to A tier, somewhere around here, good stuff, next one is IK Multimedia, I will say this is

[11:54] mostly for the players, like guitar players and so on, you get everything for 50 euros or go max

[12:00] for 100 euros, here we go, around 300 to 100 euros, it's a pretty good overall, I think overall good

[12:07] deal, so maybe high on here, if you are looking for that type of plugins, I think it's a good

[12:11] option, the next one is one of my favorite, Izotope has 60% off, just let me come clean,

[12:17] I love almost everything they do, like I use Ozone all the time, I use Neutron separate plugins

[12:22] all the time, I use Nektar all the time, I use everything from them, I think their interfaces

[12:27] are great, I think their plugins sound really good, and I recommend them to my audience because

[12:32] of that too, you have to log in to see your prices, there will be 40% discount on Izotope products

[12:40] bundles, if you're new customers and if you're existing customers, you will get 50 or 60%

[12:44] depending on what you have, and this is like easy as for me, Kilo Hearts, another company that's close to my heart

[12:50] because they are from Sweden, but not only that, I really like the things they often do, they will

[12:56] have a lot of free bundle for producers, I think it's great for community, we are going to split

[13:01] this into two, first Kilo Hearts bundle and then the Phase Plant discount, for the Phase Plant simple

[13:06] original price 200, new price 100, Phase Plant has to be best thing when it comes to modulating

[13:12] everything, give it that it's not maybe as easy as pigments and serum, but modulation options actually

[13:18] go beyond pigments and serum, almost a modular synthesizer in subtractive synthesizer package

[13:23] kind of, so I love it and put Phase Plant very early 8, and the Kilo Hearts bundle, you get the bundle

[13:29] for 300, I think it's still alright price because you get so many plugins, just let me show you how

[13:35] it looks when you install their bundle, so many things I don't even know, 300 I think still good

[13:41] price, 25% is low on the discount side, so I'm gonna put it early, simply because of that, but I like

[13:46] what they do, I think they are great company, great sound effects, great sound and scene, alright

[13:51] next one, Claveground, another Swedish company, another close to heart, overall I really like their

[13:57] design minimalist language, even though this look crazy, look how pretty is this one, however when

[14:03] it comes to Black Friday, I don't find much information about their website, they have a

[14:07] free plugin UMA, it's good, but it's not what we are looking for, that being said if we go to plugin

[14:12] boutique, you actually see they have in between 40 to like 60-70% depending on what you are getting,

[14:21] I think they could have done this on their website already, like Core Presser, this was very popular,

[14:26] core means sausage in Swedish, so sausage presser, okay what do we do, discount amount is really good

[14:33] and the price are okay, late is I think better fit to this one, the next one is Knock, another content

[14:40] creator plugin, if you don't know, it is Decap's plugin, I never used it, but I understand the

[14:45] appeal of the plugin and the main reviews of the plugin is also pretty good too, so whatever I say

[14:51] please take it with a pinch of salt, initial price is 150, I think for a plugin that does what Knock

[14:56] does a bit too much, however the discount itself is quite a bit, so it comes down all the way to 69,

[15:01] which makes it much more reasonable and because of that I'm going to put it like late A, the next

[15:06] one is Native Instruments, they already have the cyber sale active, which means that you get 50%

[15:11] off with the complete and even 50% for the upgrade prices as well, and because of that I'm going to

[15:16] be again generous and give them an S tier, I don't have any professional producer friend who doesn't

[15:22] own complete, Korg, Korg special price, the plugin bundle, many people I think looking for this to

[15:27] from 399 to 299, so we are having around 25% discount and amounts that synthesizers that you

[15:35] are getting kind of similar to R3 a bit less, 299 all right price 25% discount, I'm gonna put it like

[15:42] a mid A tier, I still like their synthesizers and emulations, so if I'm looking for a buying

[15:47] opportunity, this is probably the best time you can get it, oh I had the craftor separately here,

[15:52] you know what, because I love this plugin so much, go straight S tier, one of the most important

[15:57] for a producer is being able to trust what they hear and many times either the headphones or the

[16:04] room itself has an immense effect on what we really hear, a solution to this issue is sound

[16:09] ID, you can use sound ID as a plugin in your DAW or as a whole on your system and what it does,

[16:16] it corrects your speakers or your headphones so that you are less affected of room modes or

[16:21] frequency response of your headphone, for the headphones it is simple, you select the headphones

[16:26] that you have, in this case DT 770 Pro and we see this is actually a frequency response of my

[16:32] headphones, when you turn on the calibration, sound ID changes the curves to make it as flat

[16:37] as possible, for the room you can do exactly the same thing but with a microphone that comes with

[16:41] your sound ID, sound ID reference has 50% discount on Black Friday, so this is your perfect time to

[16:47] try it out, links in the description below, Lander, Lander has 50% off which is great and I actually

[16:53] kind of one of these person that I like their plugins and they have also this thing like you

[16:57] can get their AI masters and you can and they also like it's kind of supplies loop cloud alternative,

[17:03] they have their own version of that too and they have distribution too, so they have a lot of

[17:08] things all together, come bundles and like courses and everything and they have the partners too and

[17:13] you get all this, you really get a lot of things to be honest, look at this, you get Arturia plugins

[17:17] too, BayBaud here, this is actually kind of great isn't it, look at this, you get so many things,

[17:22] you get GeForce access too, three pitches here, well I think that makes it pretty obvious,

[17:27] the price right, the price is still quite okay, so 120 crowns per month, 10 euros per month,

[17:32] all these things, I'm debating if it's S tier or A tier, but I'm gonna go for the like very early

[17:38] A tier here, but one can argue putting on S tier too, because kind of similar to complete in a sense,

[17:44] not that complete, but yeah kind of, the next one is Malda production, now this is one company

[17:50] that has really fans online, for good reason, their free plugins are really good and you feel

[17:58] that initial connection to them, because you probably use one or more free plugins from them,

[18:03] and when it comes to the deals that have, they say up to 91% discount, but again it depends a

[18:09] little bit how we define the discount, so the most important thing probably we are looking for their

[18:13] bundle, let me try to find their bundles, bundles is here, this one is around 150 euros,

[18:18] complete bundle is around, that is expensive, around like a thousand euros, then they've created

[18:24] a bundle 35 plugin, this is a bit more in line, total fx is, dang I didn't know they were that

[18:30] expensive, what is this, turbo bundle 25, this is more reasonable, 85% off, they are great plugins,

[18:37] but the price is a bit still steep for a producer, I understand there are so many plugins and

[18:42] probably all of them are very useful, I don't know what to say, probably like,

[18:47] okay let's put it here, but I may argue here, because again for me the initial price as much

[18:54] as the final price is important, thousand euros a big commitment, I understand for a pro producers

[18:59] it's still worth probably, but many of the people who are buying these plugins are hobby producers

[19:04] and spend thousand euros even on discount for plugin bundles, it's a little bit too much,

[19:09] the next one is the mix in key, this is one of these niche product, it helps you to look at the

[19:18] tracks and try to figure out, try to figure out the energy of a track, the key of the track, bpm

[19:23] of the track, and you can even build your cues on the track, then as a dj just take that and then

[19:29] use it, and in the newer version it even finds the tracks that fits to the energy and the key

[19:35] and so on, so help you with your mixing, so it's a very useful tool for djs, mixing key pro 50%

[19:41] off, you are getting it like 43 euros, 42 euros, somewhere around here, extremely cheap for what

[19:47] you are getting, so this mix, this is the reason I wanted to put it separately, again it's a very

[19:51] niche product, if you are not dj this doesn't make sense to you, but for me this is a no-brainer,

[19:55] so S tier, the next one output, up to 50% off, output has to be one of the first companies that

[20:01] really nailed the user interface, with coming with like this modern, easy to use, fun interface

[20:08] with the good quality effects and products, they placed themselves more in the premium segment,

[20:13] hence the relatively higher prices, but on the other hand, if you for example take a look at

[20:17] effects bundle, you get thermal, portal, movement, beyond, current, these are I think presets for 199,

[20:23] it's actually kind of good deal for the things that you are getting, like thermal is really good,

[20:27] I like portal, I like movement too, even the same thing with the instruments, so I'm going to give

[20:31] them a solid A here, somewhere around here right, if it's not your first time here, you know my love

[20:37] to pigments, amazing synthesizer, very visual, sounds perfect for me, I'll leave it 50% straight

[20:43] to the S tier, now plug-in boutique, plug-in boutique always comes up with this bundle on the

[20:47] black friday, with tons of different VSTs, and from all of the different companies too, like this

[20:52] year they have this 69 dollars, who picked this, anyways price, for a premium value of almost

[21:01] 2000 dollars, from neon reverb is here, contour is here, to all of the good things, we have production

[21:06] outlaw, I don't know this one, looks good thing, like the list still goes on, axis from geforce 2,

[21:12] VX saturator, another good one, the list goes on and on, good deal for the price, good job plug-in

[21:22] my favorite 99, polyverse bundle 299 from 694, again the starting price is a bit too high, even

[21:30] though the plug-in is really good, that I use all the time, but the discount is nice too, so like but

[21:36] it's fine, another one close to heart, reason studios, it is impressive, because full license

[21:42] is 200 euros from 500, this is actually pretty good, upgrade 75, adds on 90% off, and reason plus

[21:50] impressive, 99 per year, pretty cheap, I will give it to them, and again this is kind of a niche

[21:56] thing, like if you enjoy reason as a DAW, so I'm gonna put them to the S, simply because how much

[22:03] discount they made available, good job, the next one is Rhodes, another niche products, discounts

[22:09] are pretty good too, from 274 to 100 here, and the ontology that they have different things, 159 to

[22:20] at least A, some may argue it could be even S, because the deals are good, so it depends a bit on you,

[22:26] Roland, okay they don't have the epilogue black friday yet, all right, no Roland, next, safari

[22:34] pedals, so the pedals are mostly guitarist thing, but I find them very useful for any type of

[22:40] production, I like them especially for the sound design too, and the safari pedals, first they look

[22:45] great, secondly they sound cool, thirdly they are often very cheap, for what you get, and this year

[22:51] they up 90% off they say, so everything bundle is 159, what do you get, five dollars or euros, what

[22:59] is this, five dollars per pedal, easy one, I could easily put it in S, but again it's a bit slightly

[23:06] niche, not maybe everybody's liking it, so I'm going to put the very early A, because of that,

[23:09] the next one is scaler, cool tool for creating chord progressions, or harmonies, or melodies,

[23:15] they have different modules inside scaler, and it's pretty useful, they have 30% off, discounted

[23:20] price 69, is I think very fair for what you are getting, 30% I think it deserves a like a

[23:27] mid-ground A tier, the next one is the shaper box, the last year when I commented on this, some people

[23:34] get mad at me, for the main reason, and this year I see the same, if you take a look at their website,

[23:39] you will see that 379 to 89, amazing, it is amazing, it's an amazing tool I use all the time,

[23:45] the problem is their actually regular price, outside black friday's, I think last year it was

[23:50] 99, so in reality the extra discount is around 10 dollars, this makes it very complicated, because I

[23:57] always compare the price before black friday, or like regular price, hence it will be only be able

[24:03] to go to like really late B tier, because of that, you have bigger opportunity cost with the shaper

[24:08] box, considered it like let's say Arturia, where you get 50% discount for real, all right the next

[24:14] one is Softube, there are so many Swedish companies in the plugin space I realize, they have this kind

[24:19] of like every week you get another deal, and then you get the black friday, you get the big deal,

[24:24] it's hard to judge from the discount, but the discount you will get at that, at the moment you

[24:30] have like a extra 50% with the code, on top of the discounts that exist in, for example if you buy the

[24:37] amplifier, which is this is a really good price by the way, and apply this one, you will get another

[24:42] 15%, so interior you can get it like what is it 39 here, and you apply this, I suppose yeah it does,

[24:49] it does another 15 on top, it works, so we only get this like a 30 euros, which is a really good deal,

[24:55] I don't know if I have this one, but I probably want to get this one after this right, so the deals

[25:00] are limited, but the deals are kind of really good, like I bought like this one, like this one,

[25:06] and if you get their newsletters, you can get another 25%, so very limited discount,

[25:12] bad, but good discounts for the things that you have, good, and like I think it's a bit like

[25:16] somewhere around here, maybe around here, sonible has a big discount in individual products, like

[25:21] smart eq is like 129 to 49, smart eq is if you don't know, like ai help eq, that helps you many

[25:27] extras too, and then you have smart essential 99, smart bundle, where you get seven different

[25:33] plugins, and you save 40%, and the price is 149 euros, again I'm gonna be here early as well,

[25:43] uh sonnox, so if you don't know, I had a, I'm gonna put it here, so you can watch, I had effects

[25:47] tier list for plugins, sonnox was actually F tier, because the moment that I was checking,

[25:52] the plugin costed like 249 for a limiter, or let's put it this way, there are other maximizer limiters

[25:58] that sounds is good for much better price, so I roasted them pretty hard in that video for the

[26:04] prices, and guess what happened, but like Friday happened, look at the prices now, 39 to 95, 69,

[26:10] somebody's listening, and now prices are much more in reasonable, here we go 279, you see the price,

[26:16] nobody's paying that, now the prices are much more reasonable, overall, even though some of them are

[26:22] still expensive, like if you think reverb 140, up to 140, some of guys I think still a bit in the

[26:28] expensive side, by the way this is good, I hope they continue this way, to make the plugins more

[26:33] modern, to user-friendly to use, so I think I'm gonna put them like a very early B, it's possible

[26:39] to put it A2, not here, here, sonnox, I did, did, Sony, put it here, universal audio, this was

[26:49] two years ago, I roasted them very hard, for the same problem, single plugin 250 euros, nobody's

[26:55] paying that, doesn't matter how it sounds, because there are really good alternatives out there, and

[26:58] the difference between the good alternative and the VAD is not a good justification of for paying

[27:03] like 200, 300 more, as simple as that, but they did after that, two years passed, and now their prices

[27:09] are come down much, much more reasonable levels, I guess this is what market does, people stop buying

[27:14] your stuff, if you put ridiculous prices, they have a couple of different things, they have this like

[27:18] pick 10 plugins for 99, from 50 different plugins, so it's not their whole plugin bundle, but you can

[27:23] pick like from 50 different plugins, 10 of your favorite for 100 euros, I think it's good, good job,

[27:29] well done, some of them sometimes goes for free, some of them you may already have for free,

[27:33] but some of them maybe you don't, it's good, this is the UAD custom one, I think yeah, this one is the

[27:38] choose from 160 UAD, pick three, get three, 196 plugins, 180 euros, 30 euros per plugin,

[27:45] very reasonable price for the quality that you get, UAD plugins sometimes sound very good,

[27:50] and you know what, this time, two years ago, they were F, this time they are very high, early A,

[27:56] the next one is Vocaline, you will see this theme going on and on again, and Vocaline is one of

[28:01] those that I always complain, I work a lot with the vocals lately, for past two years, and that

[28:06] means that I have tons of different captures, and I have to really align them every single time,

[28:10] and I hate it, and I hate it, because it takes too much time, it's a very boring non-creative work,

[28:15] that I don't really appreciate, and Vocaline fixes that, now the price wise 200 euros or dollars,

[28:22] is of course not cheap, but the amount of time I'm saving for myself, is extremely important,

[28:28] so my take, if you are like me, with the producers, who works with the vocals a lot,

[28:32] and value your time, get this plugin, if your producers doesn't work with the vocals, or

[28:37] vocals that you are using from Splice, or Loopcloud, everything is already fixed,

[28:41] you don't know in this, if you let me, I would actually put an S tier, because I'll use it that

[28:46] much, but I also understand it's a very niche thing again, so I'm gonna put it in A tier,

[28:50] the next one on the list is Waves, I many times commented Waves marketing strategy, and I find it

[28:57] very non-ethical, being that putting the price is very high, and giving like 90% discounts,

[29:02] and then sometimes you get a product, and you have to pay for compatibility after some years,

[29:07] you are forced to buy the new version of the product that you have, I don't like that type of

[29:12] marketing strategy, that being said, Black Friday offers you get like 93 plugins for 200,

[29:17] in a sense that's a good option, but yet again, like I said, these are very old plugins, that are

[29:23] in my own personal view, sounding not as good as the plugins that we have currently on the market,

[29:29] with let's say Softube, or UAD, and so on right, so I would rather prefer use these tools over

[29:35] Waves, I'm gonna give them still kind of a very late A, but I would also tell you, but I would

[29:42] still suggest you to read at least a bit reviews for the users, and their experiences, at least

[29:47] past one, two years, so you know the current state of Waves, the next one XLN Audio, and people know

[29:53] it from the RC-20, it's one of these plugins, that does one thing really good, and because of that,

[29:59] it became kind of a like a go-to plugin for many producers, for certain type of feeling, I think

[30:05] XO is another tool, that a lot of people really like, there is the RC-20 and XO bundle for

[30:12] 54 of, in Plugin Boutique, so I would assume, they will probably have something like this,

[30:16] in their website as well, this too for 100, yeah, I mean all right, I guess, so I'm gonna put like

[30:22] mid B tier, because of that, and that concludes our tier list, again I probably missed some,

[30:28] and there will be probably more plugin deals coming soon, so I really recommend you to share

[30:34] your opinions, like your own S tier maybe deal, so that other people know, if I missed it,

[30:39] and or the other things, that you disagree with the plugins that I told, and one thing I want to

[30:43] know, if you want me to do also hardware Black Friday deals too, I know a lot of people looking

[30:49] forward to that, but I never done that, so I don't know if my community wants that, if you do,

[30:53] let me know on the comments, all right that's it.
