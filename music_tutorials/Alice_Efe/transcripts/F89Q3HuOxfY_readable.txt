================================================================================

[00:00] The black friday is almost here and you want to know what to buy and what to skip, this

[00:04] is a classic in this channel, a black friday plugin tier list, to help exactly with that

[00:09] I have simple 3 rules, quality, discount amount and discount frequency, but in the end my

[00:15] personal opinions will decide which tier plugins get, and you may disagree, last year we had

[00:21] beautiful discussions, many commented on the opinions, their own S tier plugins and discounts,

[00:27] so I really encourage you to share your opinions below on the comment section, it is still

[00:32] early in black friday so I will miss probably some plugin deals, so I would also appreciate

[00:37] putting those on the comment section so other people can see, enough with the words, so

[00:41] let's jump in and roll some plugins.

[00:45] I did my homework, we have a lot to go through, and the first one on the list is all this

[00:51] spicy, and a deal they have on their website is buy 2 get 2 plugins, on top of that they

[00:56] have individual plugin discounts too, for example I like their situations, we see that

[01:01] they have somewhere between like 50, 60, 40, 30 depending on the plugin itself, discounts

[01:07] looks alright, combining with 2 of the 4, I think we are getting good prices, the only

[01:13] issue is that initial prices are quite high, 50% discount makes them still around like

[01:18] 100 euros, so it's still kind of expensive, so because of that I am gonna put them into

[01:24] a late A tier, again I don't have any problems with their quality, good sounding plugins,

[01:29] the price is starting to be too high, but discounts are not bad, oh yeah, autotune,

[01:35] if you have been following my channels I have a war against the pricing of the autotune

[01:41] plugins, be it Melodyne or Antares autotune, you may wonder what I mean by that, black

[01:46] friday, early bird, special deals up to 60% off, sounds great, and the one that many people

[01:53] will use, actually this one, autotune unlimited subscription, so their flagship autotune plugin,

[01:58] it is great, I use it all the time, if you now go to subscribe, 145 danish crowns per

[02:05] month with 60% discount, so this is the discounted price for the subscription, and I have no

[02:11] idea why I am getting the danish crowns, hello I am in Sweden, around 20 euros with 60% discount,

[02:18] I repeat 20 euros monthly with 60% discount, for me these prices are, I don't know, it

[02:26] is crazy, it is just autotune plugin, like I know there you get other things, but come

[02:32] again, we are really going for the autotune main with this plugin, so you are paying 20

[02:37] euros per month for just autotune plugin, so yearly 240 euros, yearly 240 euros, in

[02:45] two years you are almost paying as much as you paid for the Ableton, it is ridiculous,

[02:50] I don't have anything about the quality, but this is really ripping the customer off, so

[02:55] I am really pissed off because of that, metal dine is the same, I am gonna put it like B,

[03:01] even after 60% you are still paying insane amount of money, so I protest, the next one

[03:08] is actually relatively easier, Arturia effects bundle, currently Arturia have 50% discount

[03:14] with their effects bundle, I use many things here, I think they all sound great, you are

[03:18] getting how many? so many, oh wait 18 here, another 20 here, I don't know, let's be honest

[03:24] this already covers most of your effects needs and for 259 you are getting like 10 euros

[03:30] per plugin right, I think this is a straightforward for me, simple as tear, Sonarworks come up

[03:36] with this really cool product, sound ID, voice ID, it translates your voice or anything really

[03:42] into your vocals or different instruments as well, you get to choose from different

[03:47] factory presets, I think Maya sounds good, and to make it really obvious I am gonna record

[03:57] my own voice now, so Maya now re-sings it for me, cool isn't it, other cool thing that

[04:11] you can do, record anything that you like, convert it to instrument, maybe a drum, found

[04:21] some supplies, this vocal needs a bit support, let's use Maya again, let's a bit chorus,

[04:33] delay, from here, to here, and if you wanna try it, check the links below, this also brings

[04:44] us the Arturia V collection, again have 50% discount, this time it's 340, look at this,

[04:51] this is just insane, like how many different synthesizers that you are getting, for me

[04:56] it's no brainer, it's one of those plugin bundles that you buy once and use for many

[05:01] years, the good thing is that you will even get better price if you own an Arturia plugin,

[05:05] good job Arturia, I appreciate what you are doing for community, the next one is Pro Tools,

[05:09] and they say up to 40% off, they have different tiers, again yearly 353 is not a cheap product,

[05:18] I think it's still a bit on the higher, more expensive end of the things, do I like Pro

[05:23] Tools and Workflow, I personally don't, but that doesn't matter because everybody is different,

[05:27] it will still be around like A, because it's a good discount regardless, the next is Baby Audio,

[05:33] they have different sales for different products, I really like this one actually,

[05:37] it's like a vocoder, vocal transformer, tuner, 50%, it's a nice discount, complete bundle,

[05:43] around 250 euros from 300, alright discount, individual products get discounted even more,

[05:48] but for example even for the humanoid, even I really like them, I think 660 euro is not that

[05:53] cheap, I will because of that like go for late A tier, early B tier, somewhere around here right,

[05:59] it's alright, they are good sounding products too, that's the important part, the next one on the

[06:03] list is Captain Plugins, I will evaluate the mixing key separately, so now we are talking about more

[06:09] like Captain Plugins Epic, they have around 50%, it's like 40 euros, tools to generate beat, melody,

[06:16] chorus, it's very useful tool, especially if you need a bit more help with your theory,

[06:20] it really helps to go, good price, I'm gonna put it on the B, very early B, but it could be very

[06:26] well A too, the next one on the list, something that I never used myself, but I heard positive

[06:31] things about it from other producers, so take this one with a grain of salt, they have cradle

[06:37] everything bundle and beyond super analog, the one that I often hear positive things,

[06:42] is actually the gut particle, originally it costs around 119, currently 83 dollars,

[06:47] EQ plugin together 142 and everything bundled 427, now this is expensive isn't it, for the amount of

[06:55] things that you are getting, be free to comment below and what you think about discount, but I

[06:59] assume they don't go too much on the discount, but the discount itself is not that big, plugins

[07:04] itself starts also relatively high price, so I will probably assume like high A, early B, somewhere

[07:09] around here, let me take a sip of my coffee, the next one on the list is D16, the first thing I

[07:17] appreciate when you come into your website, it is very obvious what they are doing, 50% everything,

[07:21] simple, good job D16, I appreciate that you make it super clean for us, I think their plugins sound

[07:27] great, let's see how many total bundle 259, how many plugins do you get, all right, quite a bit,

[07:34] all their effects is all their synthesizers, 249, it is a good deal, because you get a bit more with

[07:39] the Arturia, I'm gonna compare to that, for me this is a almost the S tier, but simply because

[07:45] competition is very high, I'm gonna put it in very early A tier, this one the Deniz audio, thank you

[07:50] Deniz, making it clear, 50% for their total bundle, the first time I used them was the perfect plate,

[07:56] it was a great sounding plate, reverb, how many, 4, 12, 14 different plugins with the bundle, 419,

[08:03] I think that's pretty good, because of that I'm gonna give them right after D16 here, good price,

[08:08] Devious Machines, they are the maker of one of my favorite plugin, Infiltrator, and they have 20%

[08:13] of each plugins, and their bundle as well, 45% looks to be, so 25% is not that much for a

[08:21] Black Friday sale, I know we are kind of a bit spoiled, with all this 40, 50, 60% discounts,

[08:27] however their plugins don't go to discount that often, and moreover good sounding plugins, so early B,

[08:35] just because 25% could be still 30, but, but, but, but, I have to put something here too, right,

[08:43] Eventide, they are the OG effects producers, both for the hardware and software, and I personally

[08:50] enjoy their plugins quite a lot, there are a couple of plugins that I think they are very unique,

[08:55] like their Split EQ, now when I click, I don't see any discount, but I know they do have Black

[09:01] Friday, let's go to plugins, here we go, Newfangled audio, up to 60%, they sound great as well,

[09:07] Signature FX, 80%, 89, Super Classics, the Black Hole 440, all these classics are very cheap,

[09:15] I will say, and you can bundle them for 200, this is a really good deal, and subscription,

[09:20] and look at this, like you can get subscription for Eventide plugins, you get so many different

[09:25] things for 20 dollars, and Antares, 60% discount, 20 euro, even more expensive than this, that's

[09:33] what I'm saying, my rage against these autotune plugin providers won't end, okay, where do we put

[09:40] this, I'm not even sure if this is a Black Friday deals or just deals, I think overall you can easily

[09:45] put it in the late A, the next one is FL Studio, oh my, FL Studio has 30% discount, the one thing

[09:54] about FL Studio is you buy it once, and you get lifetime upgrades, workflow is not for me,

[10:00] but it doesn't mean that other people enjoy this type of workflow, I'm gonna put them actually in

[10:05] the S tier because of that, the next one is GeForce, and it says up to 55%, they are known for their

[10:13] emulations, nine different synthesizers I suppose, nothing against their sound, but the price wise,

[10:18] more than 400, so we see here 373, 423 euros for their bundle, so for me unfortunately the price

[10:26] is way too high considering the alternatives that we have in the market, so for me this doesn't make

[10:32] it to S or A tier, so hence we are gonna put it somewhere around here, the next one is Mercurial

[10:39] Tones, of course I have to do my shameless plug here, we have up to 40% discount, if you get one

[10:45] 25, if you get two 40%, you can actually combine any products, I wanted to do this because people

[10:51] like to combine different things into different packs themselves, so I want to give them freedom,

[10:55] if you haven't tried, if you are looking for samples and preset packs, these are my samples

[11:00] and preset packs, and even courses are here, I have different course depending on what you are

[11:04] looking for, so if you are looking to buy anything from me, this is for your time to try them out,

[11:09] and of course my very unbiased opinion, Mercurial Tones, S tier, very unbiased opinion, very objective,

[11:18] next on the list is Sound Theory, let me come clean, Crafter is my favorite clipper, I always

[11:23] say it, I think it is genius, I think it sounds great, I think the price is a bit high and I don't

[11:27] think it's too much for giving what you get, 1000 crowns like 90, 95 euros, now it's 45 euros,

[11:34] which is actually pretty good for this, and then Gullfoss from 118, 90 euros to 90 euros probably,

[11:41] overall 50% discount on both, it's great, the starting price is a bit high, not that great,

[11:47] so you know what's coming, go to A tier somewhere around here, good stuff, next one is IK

[11:52] Multimedia, I would say this is mostly for the players, like guitar players and so on,

[11:57] you get everything for 50 euros or go max for 100 euros, here we go, around 300 to 100 euros,

[12:04] 60 pretty good overall, I think overall good deal, so maybe higher on here, if you are looking for

[12:09] that type of plugins, I think it's a good option, the next one is one of my favorite,

[12:14] Izotope has 60% off, just let me come clean, I love almost everything they do, like I use those

[12:20] all the time, I use Neutron separate plugins all the time, I use Nektar all the time, I use

[12:25] everything from them, I think their interfaces are great, I think their plugins sound really good,

[12:30] and I recommend them to my audience because of that too, you have to log in to see your prices,

[12:36] there will be 40% discount on Izotope products bundles, if you are new customers and if you

[12:42] are existing customers, you will get 50 or 60% depending on what you have, and this is like

[12:47] for me, Kilohearts another company that close to my heart, because they are from Sweden,

[12:52] but not only that, I really like the things they often do, they will have a lot of free bundle for

[12:57] producers, I think it's great for community, we are going to split this into two, first Kilohearts

[13:02] bundle and then the face plant discount, for the face plant simple, original price 200,

[13:07] new price 100, face plant has to be best thing when it comes to modulating everything, give it

[13:13] that, it's not maybe as easy as pigments and serum, but modulation options actually go beyond

[13:18] pigments and serum, almost a modular synthesizer in subtractive synthesizer package kind of,

[13:24] so I love it and put face plant very early aid, and the Kilohearts bundle, you get the bundle for

[13:29] 300, I think it's still all right price because you get so many plugins, just let me show you

[13:35] how it looks when you install their bundle, so many things I don't even know, 300 I think still

[13:41] good price, 25% is low on the discount side, so I'm gonna put it early, simply because of that,

[13:46] but I like what they do, I think they are great company, great sound effects, great sound and

[13:50] scene, all right next one, Claveground, another Swedish company, another close to heart, overall

[13:56] I really like their design, minimalist language, even though this look crazy, look how pretty is

[14:01] this one, however when it comes to Black Friday, I don't find much information about their website,

[14:06] they have a free plugin giveaway, it's good, but it's not what we are looking for, that being said,

[14:11] if we go to plugin boutique, you actually see they have in between 40 to like 60, 70 percent depending

[14:20] on what you are getting, I think they could have done this on their website already, like core

[14:24] presser, this was very popular, core means sausage in Swedish, so sausage presser, okay what do we do,

[14:31] discount amount is really good and the price are okay, late is I think better fit to this one,

[14:35] the next one is Knock, another content creator plugin, if you don't know, it is Decap's plugin,

[14:42] I never used it, but I understand the appeal of the plugin and the mean reviews of the plugins

[14:48] also pretty good too, so whatever I say, please take it with a pinch of salt, initial price is

[14:53] 150, I think for a plugin that does what Knock does a bit too much, however the discount itself

[14:59] is quite a bit, so it comes down all the way to 69, which makes it much more reasonable and because

[15:04] of that, I'm gonna put it like late A, the next one is Native Instruments, they already have the cyber

[15:09] sale active, which means that you get 50% off with the complete and even 50% for the upgrade prices

[15:15] as well, and because of that, I'm gonna be again generous and give them an S tier, I don't have any

[15:20] professional producer friend who doesn't own complete, Korg, Korg special price, the plugin

[15:25] bundle, many people I think looking for this to buy from 399 to 299, so we are having around 25

[15:32] discount, and the amount that synthesizers that you are getting, kind of similar to Artery, a bit

[15:37] less, 299, alright price, 25% discount, I'm gonna put it like a mid A tier, I still like their

[15:44] synthesizers and emulations, so if I'm looking for a buying opportunity, this is probably the best

[15:49] time you can get it, oh I had the Crafter separately here, you know what, because I love this plugin so

[15:54] much, go straight S tier, one of the most important thing for a producer is being able to trust what

[16:01] they hear, and many times, either the headphones or the room itself has an immense effect on what

[16:06] we really hear, a solution to this issue is Sound ID, you can use Sound ID as a plugin in your DAW

[16:13] or as a whole on your system, and what it does, it corrects your speakers or your headphones,

[16:19] so that you are less affected of room modes or frequency response of your headphone,

[16:23] for the headphones it is simple, you select the headphones that you have, in this case DT770 Pro,

[16:28] and we see, this is actually a frequency response of my headphones, when you turn on the calibration,

[16:34] Sound ID changes the curves to make it as flat as possible, for the room you can do exactly the

[16:39] same thing, but with a microphone that comes with your Sound ID, Sound ID reference has 50%

[16:44] discount on Black Friday, so this is your perfect time to try it out, links in the description below,

[16:49] Lander, Lander has 50% off, which is great, and I actually kind of one of these person that I

[16:54] like their plugins, and they have also this thing like, you can get their AI masters, and you can,

[17:00] and they also like, it's kind of supplies loop cloud alternative, they have their own version

[17:04] of that too, and they have distribution too, so they have a lot of things all together, come bundles,

[17:10] and like courses, and everything, and they have the partners too, and you get all this, you really get

[17:15] a lot of things to be honest, look at this, you get Arturia plugins too, maybe I'll do it here,

[17:19] this is actually kind of great isn't it, look at this, you get so many things, you get GeForce access

[17:24] too, three pitches here, well I think that makes it pretty obvious, the price right, the price is still

[17:29] quite okay, so 120 crowns per month, 10 euros per month, all these things, I'm debating if it's

[17:35] S tier or A tier, but I'm gonna go for the like very early A tier here, but one can argue putting

[17:40] on S tier too, because kind of similar to complete, in a sense, not that complete, but yeah kind of,

[17:47] next one is Malda production, now this is one company that has really fans online, for good

[17:54] reason, their free plugins are really good, and you feel that initial connection to them, because

[18:00] you probably use one or more free plugins from them, and when it comes to deals that have, they

[18:05] say up to 91% discount, but again it depends a little bit how we define the discount, so the

[18:11] most important thing probably we are looking for their bundle, let me try to find their bundles,

[18:15] this one is around 150 euros, complete bundle is around, that is expensive, around like a thousand

[18:23] euros, then they have creative bundle 35 plugin, this is a bit more in line, total fx is, dang I

[18:29] didn't know they were that expensive, what is this, turbo bundle 25, this is more reasonable, 85% off,

[18:35] they are great plugins, but the price is a bit still steep for a producer, I understand there

[18:41] are so many plugins, and probably all of them are very useful, I don't know what to say, probably

[18:45] like, okay let's put it here, but I may argue here, because again for me the initial price as much as

[18:54] the final price is important, thousand euros a big commitment, I understand for a pro producers,

[19:00] it's still worth probably, but many of the people who are buying these plugins are hobby producers,

[19:04] and spend thousand euros even on discount for plugin bundles, it's a little bit too much,

[19:09] the next one is the mix in key, this is one of these niche product, it helps you to look at the

[19:18] tracks, and try to figure out, try to figure out the energy of a track, the key of the track, bpm

[19:23] of the track, and you can even build your cues on the track, then as a dj just take that, and then

[19:29] use it, and in the newer version it even finds the tracks that fits to the energy, and the key,

[19:35] and so on, so help you with your mixing, so it's a very useful tool for djs, mixing key pro 50%

[19:41] off, you are getting it like 43 euros, 42 euros, somewhere around here, extremely cheap for what

[19:47] you are getting, so this makes, this is the reason I wanted to put it separately, again it's a very

[19:51] niche product, if you are not dj, this doesn't make sense to you, but for me this is a no-brainer,

[19:55] so S tier, the next one output, up to 50% off, output

[20:00] has to be one of the first companies that really nailed the user interface with coming

[20:04] with like this modern, easy to use, fun interface with the good quality effects and products.

[20:10] They placed themselves more in the premium segment, hence the relatively higher prices.

[20:15] But on the other hand, if you, for example, take a look at effects bundle, you get thermal,

[20:19] portal, movement, beyond, current. These are I think presets for 199. It's actually kind

[20:24] of good deal for the things that you are getting, like thermal is really good. I like portal,

[20:27] I like movement too. They want the same thing with their instruments. So I'm going to give

[20:31] them a solid A here, somewhere around here, right? If it's not your first time here, you

[20:35] know my love to pigments, amazing synthesizer, very visual, sounds perfect for me. I'll leave

[20:41] it 50% straight to the S tier. Now plug-in boutique, plug-in boutique always comes up

[20:46] with this bundle on the Black Friday with tons of different VSTs. And from all of the

[20:57] price for appearing the value of almost to $2,000 from Neon Reverb is here, Contour

[21:04] is here, to all of the good things, we have Protection Outlaw, I don't know this one,

[21:08] looks good thing, like the list still goes on. Axis from GeForce too, VX Saturator, another

[21:13] good one. The list goes on and on. Good deal for the price. Good job plug-in boutique,

[21:19] so no surprise. Polyverse, Filterverse, 99, Manipulator, one of my favorite, 99, Polyverse

[21:25] bundle, $2.99 from $6.94. Again, the starting price is a bit too high, even though the plug-in

[21:31] is really good, that I use all the time. But the discount is nice too, so like, but it's

[21:35] fine. Another one close to heart, Reason Studios. It is impressive because full license is $200

[21:42] from $500, this is actually pretty good. Upgrade is 75, adds on 90% off and Reason Plus, impressive,

[21:50] 99 per year, pretty cheap. I will give it to them. Again, this is kind of a niche thing,

[21:57] like if you enjoy Reason as a DAW, so I'm gonna put them to the S, simply because how much

[22:03] discount they made available. Good job. The next one is Rhodes, another niche products.

[22:09] Discounts are pretty good too, from $2.74 to $100 here, and the ontology that they have different

[22:14] things, $159 to $69, so discount itself is pretty good. I think it's a good case of being at least

[22:20] A, some may argue it could be even S, because the deals are good. So it depends a bit on you.

[22:26] Roland. Okay, they don't have the Aperola Black Friday yet. Alright, no Roland. Next, Safari

[22:33] Pedals. So the pedals are mostly guitarist thing, but I find them very useful for any type of

[22:40] production. I like them especially for the sound design too. And the Safari Pedals, first, they

[22:50] and this year they up to 90% off, they say. So everything bundle is $159. What do you get?

[22:58] $5 or euros. What is this? $5 per pedal. Easy one. I could easily put it in the S,

[23:04] but again, it's a bit slightly niche, not maybe everybody's liking it. So I'm going to put the

[23:08] very early A, because of that. The next one is Scaler. Cool tool for creating chord progressions

[23:13] or harmonies or melodies. They have different modules inside Scaler, and it's pretty useful.

[23:18] They have 30% off. Discounted price $69 is, I think, very fair for what you are getting. 30%,

[23:25] I think it deserves a like a mid-ground A tier. The next one is the Shaper Box.

[23:31] The last year when I commented on this, some people get mad at me for the main reason. And

[23:36] this year I see the same. If you take a look at their website, you will see that $379 to $89.

[23:42] Amazing. It is amazing. It's an amazing tool I use all the time. The problem is their actually

[23:46] regular price outside Black Friday's, I think last year it was $99. So in reality, the extra

[23:53] discount is around $10. This makes it very complicated, because I always compare the price

[23:59] before Black Friday or like regular price. Hence, it will be only be able to go to like really late

[24:05] B tier because of that. You have bigger opportunity cost with the Shaper Box,

[24:09] considered like, let's say, Arturia, where you get 50% discount for real.

[24:13] All right, the next one is Softube. There are so many Swedish companies in the playing space,

[24:18] I realize. They have this kind of like every week you get another deal, and then you get the Black

[24:23] Friday, you get the big deal. It's hard to judge from the discount, but the discount you will get

[24:28] at that, at the moment you have like a extra 50% with the code, on top of the discounts that

[24:33] exist. For example, if you buy the Engel amplifier, which is, this is a really good price by the way,

[24:40] and apply this one, you will get another 15%. So in theory, you can get it like, what is it?

[24:45] 39 here, and you apply this, I suppose. Yeah, it does. It does another 15 on top. It works.

[24:51] So we only get this like a 30 euros, which is a really good deal. I don't know if I have this one,

[24:56] but I probably want to get this one after this, right? So the deals are limited, but the deals

[25:02] are kind of really good. Like I bought like this one, like this one, and if you get their newsletters,

[25:07] you can get another 25%. So very limited discount, bad, but good discounts for the things that you

[25:13] have, good. And like, I think it's like somewhere around here, maybe around here. Sonible has a big

[25:19] discount in individual products, like Smart EQ is like 129 to 49. Smart EQ is if you don't know,

[25:24] like AI help EQ, that helps you many extras too. And then you have Smart Essential 99, Smart Bundle,

[25:31] where you get seven different plugins, and you save 40%, and the price is 149 euros. Again,

[25:39] I'm going to be here early as well. Sonox. So if you don't know, I had, I'm going to put it here,

[25:46] so you can watch. I had a fixed tier list for plugins. Sonox was actually F tier, because the

[25:51] moment that I was checking, the plugin costed like 249 for a limiter. Or let's put this way,

[25:56] there are other maximizer limiters that sounds as good for much better price. So I roasted them

[26:02] pretty hard in that video for the prices. And guess what happened? But like Friday happened,

[26:07] look at the prices now, 39 to 95, 69. Somebody's listening, and now prices are much more

[26:13] unreasonable. Here we go, 279. You see the price, nobody's paying that. Now the prices are much more

[26:20] reasonable, overall, even though some of them are still expensive. Like if you think reverb,

[26:24] up to 140. Some of that is, I think, still a bit in the expensive side. By the way, this is good.

[26:30] I hope they continue this way to make the plugins more modern, to user-friendly to use. So I think

[26:35] I'm going to put them like very early B. It's possible to put it A too, not here, here. Sonox.

[26:46] Put here. Universal audio. This was two years ago. I roasted them very hard for the same problem.

[26:52] Single plugin, 250 euros. Nobody's paying that. It doesn't matter how much it sounds,

[26:56] because there are really good alternatives out there. And the difference between the good

[26:59] alternative and the UAD is not a good justification for paying like 200, 300 more. As simple as that.

[27:05] But they did after that, two years passed, and now their prices have come down much,

[27:10] much more reasonable levels. I guess this is what market does. People stop buying your stuff if you

[27:14] put ridiculous prices. They have a couple of different things. They have this like pick 10

[27:18] for 99 from 50 different plugins. So it's not their whole plugin bundle, but you can pick like

[27:23] from 50 different plugins. 10 of your favorite for 100 euros. I think it's good. Good job. Well

[27:29] done. Some of them sometimes goes for free. Some of them you may already have for free,

[27:33] but some of them maybe you don't. It's good. This is the UAD custom one. I think, yeah,

[27:37] this one is the choose from 160 UAD. Pick three, get three. 196 plugins, 180 euros,

[27:43] 30 euros per plugin. Very reasonable price for the quality that you get. UAD's plugins

[27:49] tend to sound very good. And you know what? This time, two years ago, they were F this time. They

[27:54] are very high early A. The next one is Vocaline. You will see this theme going on and on again.

[27:59] And Vocaline is one of those that I always complain. I work a lot with the vocals lately

[28:04] for past two years. And that means that I have tons of different captures and I have to real

[28:09] every single time. And I hate it. And I hate it because it takes too much time. It's a very boring

[28:14] non-creative work that I don't really appreciate. And Vocaline fixes that. Now the price wise 200

[28:20] euros or dollars is of course not cheap, but the amount of time I'm saving for myself is extremely

[28:27] important. So my take, if you are like me with the producers who works with the vocals a lot

[28:32] and value your time, get this plugin. If your producers doesn't work with the vocals or

[28:37] vocals that you are using from Splice or Loopcloud, everything is already fixed. You don't

[28:42] know in this. If you let me, I would actually put an S tier because I'll use it that much. But I also

[28:47] understand it's a very niche thing again. So I'm going to put it in A tier. The next one on the

[28:51] list is Waves. I have many times commented Waves marketing strategy and I find it very non-ethical.

[28:58] Being that putting the price is very high and giving like 90% discounts. And then sometimes

[29:03] you get a product and you have to pay for compatibility after some years. You are forced

[29:08] to buy the new version of the product that you have. I don't like that type of marketing strategy.

[29:13] That being said, Black Friday offers you get like 93 plugins for 200. In a sense that is a good

[29:19] option. But yet again, like I said these are very old plugins that are in my own personal view

[29:25] sounding not as good as the plugins that we have currently on the market with let's say Softube

[29:31] or UAD and so on right. So I would rather prefer use these tools over Waves. I'm gonna give them

[29:37] still kind of an a very late A. But I would also tell you, but I would still suggest you to read

[29:43] at least a bit reviews for the users and their experiences at this past one two years. So you

[29:48] know the current state of Waves. The next one XLN Audio and people know it from the RC-20. It's one

[29:55] of these plugins that does one thing really good. And because of that it became kind of a like a

[30:01] go-to plugin for many producers for certain type of feeling. I think XO is another tool that elder

[30:07] people really like. There is the RC-20 and XO bundle for 54 of in Plugin Boutique. So I would assume

[30:14] they will probably have something like this in their website as well. This 2400 yeah I'm in

[30:22] B tier because of that. And that concludes our tier list. Again I probably missed some and there

[30:29] will be probably more plugin deals coming soon. So I really recommend you to share your opinions

[30:34] like your own S tier maybe deals. So that other people know if I missed it and or the other things

[30:40] that you disagree with the plugins that I told. And one thing I want to know. So if you want me to do

[30:45] also Hardware Black Friday deals too. I know a lot of people looking forward to that. But I never

[30:50] done that. So I don't know if my comment demands that. If you do let me know in the comments.

[30:55] All right that's it.
