================================================================================

[00:00] This shape and this sound is the reason why most of the beginner and intermediate producers

[00:06] fail with their drums.

[00:08] I have created a whole interactive visualization to demonstrate the problem, showing you why

[00:13] and how it happens, and I will reveal where you can find this interactive tool for free

[00:18] later in the video.

[00:19] I'm Elis and welcome to my series, if you can learn one trick today, learn this.

[00:23] Hop in.

[00:24] Drums means compression, and compression can be very confusing or surprising for beginner

[00:29] and intermediate producers, and the first rule of compression with drums is controlling

[00:34] the transcends.

[00:35] Let's take a look at this, we have a transcend drum sound, and we will try to control this

[00:39] with a compressor.

[00:40] What beginners and intermediate producers do, they will bring the threshold down, begin

[00:44] to compress this, ratio, classic, 4-5, something like this, very short attack and very short

[00:50] decay, but didn't change much, did it?

[00:52] And they will just decrease the threshold, increase the ratio, but what is going on right?

[00:57] The transcend is still there.

[00:59] Most of the compressors, even they will tell you like 0.5, 0.1 or 1 ms, 1 ms, the way they

[01:06] react, they won't be able to catch the very fast transcends, which drums often times have.

[01:12] And you will end up this with shape, and this, believe it or not, actually will sound worse

[01:18] than the original sound.

[01:19] Go back to your projects, check the sounds that you applied to similar compressor settings,

[01:23] print them and look what you are seeing.

[01:26] I assure you, this shape will come back and back again.

[01:29] If you have couple of them stacked on top of each other, you will have really hard time

[01:33] in the mastering due to the strange peaks.

[01:36] After you solve this, this is a very simple method.

[01:38] Before compressing your signals, add a clipper.

[01:41] Clipper just shade the sound if it goes above a threshold.

[01:45] Trim that transcend, and clipping actually will lead a crunchier sound due to clipping

[01:50] distortion.

[01:50] And then, I can actually use much gentle attack and decay settings.

[01:55] Now we are compressing with slower decay.

[01:58] Look how beautiful it looks.

[02:00] This will sound much better than any of the other shapes that we are seeing here.

[02:04] It will sound fatter, it will sound fuller, it will sound crispier.

[02:11] And I promise I will give you more like this.

[02:13] Now let me prove it to you.

[02:14] This sound over here.

[02:16] Let's use a compressor very fast, like this.

[02:19] Faster is fast attack 4 ratio, like this.

[02:22] Let's bounce this.

[02:24] Do you see that?

[02:26] We created that shape we are talking.

[02:28] That's like initial boom, and then everything is clamped down.

[02:31] If you gain compensate this, it will look worse than the original sound.

[02:35] This explosive transcend in the beginning.

[02:37] There will be worse than this.

[02:38] What is the solution?

[02:39] Let's clip first now.

[02:41] Clip that transcend.

[02:45] And a gentle compression afterwards.

[02:51] Slight gain.

[02:52] Let's bounce this.

[02:54] And look at this.

[02:56] This is beautiful.

[02:57] That initial transient is still there.

[03:00] Even stronger, but the balance is much better too.

[03:02] This was a single sound.

[03:03] Let's apply this in a loop.

[03:09] This transcend actually kind of bothers me quite a bit in this loop.

[03:12] So I'm gonna use the same tactic.

[03:14] Clip.

[03:16] Soft glue compression.

[03:18] Let's bounce this.

[03:19] Do you see what we have done?

[03:20] Look at the shapes.

[03:21] They look immediately fatter.

[03:22] And look, it is quieter on the peaks.

[03:25] So this will actually hit your limiter much less.

[03:28] But it will still sound fatter than original.

[03:30] Cool, isn't it?

[03:30] The pro's trick.

[03:32] Okay, back to the premise.

[03:33] This is a free tool I created for you.
