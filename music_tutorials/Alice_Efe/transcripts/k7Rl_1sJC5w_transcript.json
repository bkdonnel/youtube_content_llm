    "text": "one of the Achilles heels for many producers making properly hard-hitting grooves I get it, it can be hard to understand the intricacies of a good hard-hitting groove but don't be afraid I'm here to hold your hand and show you how to make it the hard groove starts with a good kick where to find good kick for hard techno there is only one place this is where I get mine we have this I'm gonna make it shorter it kind of has this analog dirt it just makes it warmer and nicer to my taste let's do it four to the floor we are at 155 so really hard techno bpm now for this type of hard-hitting groove you have to build a bit of layer with your basses because they are really full and the way I like to start is always put first your sub bass and build upon it I actually don't like using rolling bass lines when it's so high in the bpm for the sub bass because there's not enough space to go up and down so we're gonna build one long sub bass for the sound be really minimal so we have this soft hood filter on top no effects whatsoever very simple however we want to have sidechain to the kick so make this transition here when the kick and sub hits smoother how do you do this we can use any sidechain plugin that you want because people were complaining that I'm using too much external effects this time we are making our decker inside Ableton we have the shaper automating the gain so basically sidechaining to the kick and a slight eq to make it a bit like darker and emptier in the middle the reason for this one is actually creating space for the layers that we are going to add on on this one you want a grit bass something with a lot of punch and body to grit the work you have to have a lot of distortion and you have to nail that in your face feeling first we have a sub hood and then another oscillator this is mostly for modulating this one a bit so right it gives this metallic character and the movement on the filter comes from this nice gradual increasing envelope and then what you need compress it oddity distort it and equalize it now if you play together they will sound a bit weird too bassy right remove all the low and just be the regular high pass I don't care too much about the face here if you're worried about the face you can just import utility and set and flip the faces it's really the same right it doesn't matter that much and then we're gonna use the ducker again to build that sucking in side to the kick effect however this is like a top bass this is the emin so we need a bit more whole feel on the background we can add a reverb chain so we have this whole thing and together now we have this if you feel like you're going to try this please consider like and subscribe and I promise I will make more videos like this for you now this actually can be many times already enough for a bass line in a hard track however in the parts where the drop comes in you want to have sometimes even more excitement so we will call this one the mean low end and then the rest we will call the aux basis so when you need that type of hard hitting part you can activate the aux basis to emphasize the groove and for the aux basis you actually really can go out of what you did in the low end itself in the low end we have this upbeat so good but we can put any rolling baseline or the release baseline whatever baseline you want on top of this because again it will be an octave up it will be more like a color but remember that if you have another baseline on top you again need to shave those tops a little bit more so there's a space on top of this so what i'm gonna do you can use eq like this and all that low and now kind of low pass and contained a little bit this one just gives me room for designing my high bass a bit better then you can adjust the eq depending on how you feel so let's go rolling baseline we're in the e just a regular rolling baseline now the sound is very important you want to sound bright and in your face and remember we are an octave up so if you just take a look at the eq you will see right 9365 even that part is not that loud so we are really focusing on those mid-low okay how to make sound again i'm keeping things but focusing on certain areas we have this it's from my forge pack by the way if you want to get rid of this type of aggressive sounds either take a look at my forge or verge techno packs they have like this type of tons of sounds but we have first this simple rolling important thing is having this very sharp envelope so it's very tight because we are rolling very fast at 155 bpm it's very fast and this long envelope on top and the noise part is important because noise will add now a little excitement and then we got the effects making it even more dynamic by automating high boost and low cut like this so it's like distorting even more even more by the tree and compressing it's so in your face to make this work even better than we have just a slight eq and then of course sidechain the kick but this time your sidechain is not that aggressive we are letting the initial path a little bit trip so it's together now we have this without the ekey cut that we did you see that the sounds will combine a bit too much the way in a track that actually use this you start the track like this without the rolling bass line like this and in the climax in the part that you really need end of energy then you low pass this part and activate the aux places we are not done now we can make it even more crazier more aggressive by kind of finding sample or utilizing another really high-end screech type of sound i have this sample over here this is only the process so there's nothing to do but the idea is more important we have this type of very screechy sound and this is gonna make things even crazier again this sits quite high when you activate if you know my channel i don't actually like to build my bases this way but genres are different and considering genre specific techniques are important so i wouldn't make a melodic techno love and like this but i will definitely go for creating this type of very hard hitting techno grooves right the one thing that you can do actually if you want to make the even more in your face you can take that kick and put it on the off beat and actually smooth it out a little bit so that the initial bump a bit softer so it's a bit also sucking effect and low pass it very hard so you have this kind of almost tom like effect to emphasize the kind of pumping feel even more like this do you hear that well it's very subtle you can make it of course less subtle almost like a rumble but much more defined and in your face rumble in this case but it's up to you it's not a must but it is something that i do really enjoy in a track like this so like this now in a club this hits super hard but of course for a groove you need the drums now don't exaggerate your drums if you want to go for this type of rich bass we are not making shrugs so there is not so much industrial drums in this one we are making more like main room hard techno style so there will most of the times we either have vocals or melodies or synths on this so you need to give space to them let's start with a simple clap it'll be the reverb on top again see how much i'm actually high passing the sound again we have so much things going on i want to cut out as much as space possible in the mid area distortion and a slight compression now we have this and for the high hats now this is the place you can do quite many cool tricks to be honest we will start with the 16 hat the sound itself is very simple and we have slight groove on it but we will create even more groove but first adding a velocity randomness this will just increase the randomness of each hit but then i'm gonna get a shaper and add this in the volume so it's kind of creating side turn kick feel but not really it has this kind of nice groove on top right and then we got controls and we random pan so it's also panning right left as well so this will add a lot of space and depth immediately to the groove that you have without almost taking no space whatsoever especially when you like excite the highs a little bit more listen to this do you see how immediately it opens up the mix without this is due to the human hearings focusing much more in the mids and high mids when it comes to stereo image so we immediately realized how spacious it gets when you do this trick but this is not enough i want more groove what do we do we get zero keep the 16 style we create very short envelope but then we take lfo2 like we did with the shaper and put it on the level more importantly we also put it on decay so this will lead to kind of this opening up getting bigger hi-hat feel and this is a noise so it is just there to excite the track listen right it's one of the simplest way to actually excite your head and add movement to them listen now you don't feel like there are two hats it feels like one hat is opening you can do this by automating decay as well but i feel like when you do with the white noise it feels the high end spectrum a bit more it excites a bit more now listen again immediately groove starts to leave and final step is of course just emphasizing those off hats so we have this like feel for that again we utilize relish to add a bit of randomness but this time if you take a look we have this layering going on here with this and then we just have this excellent hats to just make it a bit groovier together we turn into this i'm of course adding quite a bit of distortion on top and again exciting this area and such subtle compression this is actually sent to plate reverb here all drums are sent to plate reverb to create this room feeling they sit beautifully in a room and final step is just adding a drone you can use anything for this one this is really tasting this coming from my silk preset pack it's just like this whooing drone sound it fits to this track because we have this kind of i don't know how to explain whooing vibe in whole track the one thing that you can do you can duplicate this and create actually a bit more like a turnarounds with your kicks by utilizing this type of hits for example here at around four bar we are doing a turnaround just exciting the track a bit and all together now we have this gorgeous groove going on the one thing that i like to do oftentimes actually add a bit saturation and limiting to the low end group just to catch the low ends peaks and glue them a bit together like this and you can do the very similar things with your drums as well and then we have this really glued together perfection this is actually groove of the template that i created for hard techno producers but if you want to stay here and learn more about techno production i have a take a look",
