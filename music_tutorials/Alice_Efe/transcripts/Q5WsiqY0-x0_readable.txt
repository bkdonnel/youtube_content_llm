================================================================================

[00:01] Does this sound pure to you?

[00:04] No.

[00:04] It sounds plastic.

[00:05] It sounds like a calculator, not an instrument.

[00:08] This is because digital synths are mathematically perfect.

[00:11] And your brain hates perfection.

[00:15] It reads it as fake.

[00:17] The real instruments, they drift, they break, they struggle.

[00:21] That imperfection is what makes them expensive.

[00:24] So I took the cheapest, a free synthesizer, and injected it with that imperfections.

[00:30] Listen one more time.

[00:38] The both are exactly the same free plugin, one of the simplest digital synths that you

[00:43] can ever get.

[00:44] The difference is this.

[00:45] The imperfection protocol.

[00:46] And let me show you why should you use it in your next sound.

[00:49] To make this work, I took one of the simplest synthesizers.

[00:52] This one is called KHS-1 from Kilohertz.

[00:55] They actually discontinued this plugin.

[00:57] But I wanted to have something very simple.

[01:00] And this is quite simple.

[01:01] So initial sound, single oscillator, simple envelope, everything else is turned off.

[01:09] This is as digital and plastic as it gets.

[01:12] Consider four things when you are making your sound more analog or authentic.

[01:16] The first one is source instability.

[01:18] That means making the oscillators or the source of your sound less stable.

[01:24] The first thing, introduce second oscillator, one octave down, detune it slightly, increase

[01:32] the gain, it's a bit muddy, don't worry about it, we want that muddiness, that imperfection.

[01:38] But this is still too sterile.

[01:40] The thing I like to do, introducing a wobble, a pitch shift up and down, making the sound

[01:45] coming from like a vintage synthesizer.

[01:47] Many ways to do this one.

[01:48] One of the simplest way, using echo, from sync to time, 1-1, 100% wet, and take off

[01:53] the filter.

[01:55] So it should basically doesn't change the sound.

[01:57] What happens is you go to wobble.

[02:04] If I can make it 100%, you can hear a bit better, right?

[02:07] We don't want that much.

[02:08] And I want a subtle noise, like a cassette noise.

[02:13] Hear that?

[02:18] That subtle pitch drift.

[02:19] If you enjoyed the video up to now, please consider like and subscribe, and I promise

[02:23] I will make more videos like this.

[02:25] Number two, reactive modulation.

[02:27] When you are playing an instrument, your touch, your pick, so that the volume and the character

[02:32] of the sound changes every single hit.

[02:34] How can we generate this in a simple synthesizer like this?

[02:37] You are in 2026, at least.

[02:40] That means that you have tools that you need inside your DAW.

[02:43] I'm gonna start with Envelope MIDI.

[02:45] You map the parameters that you want to modulate inside your synthesizers.

[02:49] For me, the most important parameters are filter decay, how fast filter moves back and

[02:54] forward, amplitude decay, how fast the volume of the sound decays, filter itself, the cutoff,

[02:59] how open the filter is, and filter envelope, how fast the filter moves.

[03:03] These four would already get you tons of different variations in your sound.

[03:07] You don't need to overcomplicate the things.

[03:09] To add that variation in perfection, I will start with the LFO.

[03:13] That will help you to move things around, modulate the things.

[03:16] Then, you click map, and map each parameter on your synthesizer.

[03:20] Let's start with filter envelope.

[03:27] Can you feel the filter is opening?

[03:30] Look at here.

[03:31] Let's put it on the volume decay.

[03:40] And let's put it on the filter as well.

[03:50] Without.

[03:55] With.

[03:57] Can you hear the sound is breathing?

[03:59] But for me, we are just starting.

[04:02] I also want slower, longer movement on my cutoff, so that I can emphasize this building

[04:07] up.

[04:07] Another filter, the previous filter was just sine wave up and down.

[04:11] The next filter is on rate of one bar.

[04:14] So building, building up, going down.

[04:15] And we cannot jitter, so it's not perfect.

[04:17] Again, we like this type of mode.

[04:19] And I'm gonna put a bit smooth.

[04:21] Look at that.

[04:22] Looks very analog, isn't it?

[04:23] And on the cutoff.

[04:32] Suddenly, everything sounds much more analog.

[04:35] We are just starting.

[04:36] I want to emphasize those highs, when I pluck the string.

[04:40] What can you do?

[04:41] Bring an envelope midi.

[04:42] We are simulating that pluck.

[04:44] Bring an equalizer.

[04:45] First slight curve, just emphasize lows and highs a bit.

[04:53] This is reactor modulation.

[04:55] This is a reflection of human playing instrument in digital domain.

[04:58] It's not every day, a new plugin comes and impresses me.

[05:01] But today, is not one of those days.

[05:03] Let me introduce you the Wingman.

[05:05] It's a new plugin from Mixing Key.

[05:07] And the idea is simple.

[05:08] A simple plugin, that can help you build your chords, your melodies, your basses, be a wingman

[05:13] of yours in music production.

[05:15] Let's take a simple example.

[05:20] The way it works, you record your audio, clicking this record.

[05:37] And it immediately, extremely fast, creates a chord progression for me, that I can try

[05:42] out in the vocal and a bass on top.

[05:44] So we have the bass and the chords.

[05:46] And if you play together, you will hear.

[06:01] This was really a perfect chord progression for this vocal.

[06:04] And if you saw the bass, here's the bass.

[06:08] And this is the chords.

[06:12] Not only that, it creates actually different variations.

[06:15] So if you don't like the first one, you can scroll through.

[06:26] This is good too.

[06:28] So you can go through the different variations for your vocals, and pick the one that you

[06:33] enjoy.

[06:34] But it also does stamp separation.

[06:35] What does that mean?

[06:36] For example, let's try it on this one.

[06:41] Put on the Wingman.

[06:42] Let's record this part.

[06:51] And we have immediately the vocals, instrument, bass and drums.

[07:02] This is very handy, especially if you want to come up with new ideas, change the chord

[07:05] progression.

[07:06] So for example, here, now we have this.

[07:15] Also, you can create your chord progression based on different parts of your stems too.

[07:19] For example, if you're going to go after the bass, then you can have a completely new chord

[07:23] progression made after the bass.

[07:32] And anytime if you're happy with anything, it's as easy as just pulling the midi and

[07:38] dropping down.

[07:39] Then you can actually change it the way you want.

[07:41] Pretty cool.

[07:42] It's a very cool plugin.

[07:43] So if you want to try it yourself, check the links on the below.

[07:45] Tree texture creation.

[07:46] We still have very clean sound.

[07:49] So we need type of a texture in the sound.

[07:52] So it feels even more natural.

[07:53] I like to start easy, erosion on the high.

[07:56] And this will introduce this like noise like sound.

[08:06] But I also want dynamic saturation on top of that.

[08:10] We had already our envelope midi.

[08:12] What you need to do, taking that, putting a saturation.

[08:15] I'm using simple analog clip and putting drive and drive wet into that envelope.

[08:19] So every hit creates a bit sudden saturation texture in the sound.

[08:31] Here's an A B, so you can hear how much difference we made.

[08:41] Without any effects on this, if you take this loop and give it to your analog obsessed friend,

[08:47] I guarantee you many of them would think this is analog sound and tell you how they immediately

[08:51] understand it from the dynamics of the sound, the character, the saturation.

[08:56] This is something I like to do to my analog friends and watch their faces afterwards.

[09:01] But this is not that.

[09:02] We need to put this into a space now.

[09:04] The first, I want to give a bit stereo.

[09:06] I'm going to use auto pan.

[09:10] So this helps me with the dynamic positioning.

[09:13] But the main room feeling comes from a reverb.

[09:16] Any reverb you like.

[09:17] To keep it simple, Ableton's medium dark plate with 25%.

[09:20] The most important thing is actually cutting up a bit too low so we don't muddle too much.

[09:26] And using it very subtly.

[09:28] So 21% wetness.

[09:33] This is the sound.

[09:34] So we are having a plate.

[09:42] Then I want the whole.

[09:44] So instant reflections from the plate and bigger reflection from the whole simulation.

[09:48] This time, we go for the return channel so that I can control the sound more.

[09:53] Send it there.

[09:54] So this solo the channel.

[09:56] See how big it is?

[10:04] And we are cleaning up all this high so we have this much cleaner sound.

[10:12] Together.

[10:21] It's very subtle in the background.

[10:23] And then I want my delays.

[10:25] Up to now this sound is very focused in the middle.

[10:27] I intentionally didn't use any unison because I want to show you a single oscillator is

[10:32] oftentimes enough to get this really rich sound.

[10:35] But we do.

[10:35] Go to our second return channel.

[10:40] We have a ping pong delay.

[10:42] This is where the stereo is created.

[10:45] Moves slightly and side changes sound itself.

[10:48] So we are ducking each time we play a note.

[10:53] So this helps with not muddying the track.

[10:56] Together.

[11:04] Amazing.

[11:05] We haven't done it.

[11:06] I like to put also very fast delay to just emphasize those stereos even more.

[11:10] Another send channel.

[11:11] This time we have very fast 116th slap delay with no feedback.

[11:19] This high side sound.

[11:22] Together.

[11:29] Now do you want cherry on top?

[11:30] A glue compression.

[11:32] This will make things even more glued together in the origin sound.

[11:41] Slow attack fast release.

[11:43] So we can let that those initial transients pass a bit through.

[11:55] And final piece in the puzzle is actually another filter.

[11:59] That you have your envelope on the filter frequency.

[12:02] So you can open and close the sound the way you like.

[12:12] And slight touches with EQ.

[12:21] And look at this beautiful sound.

[12:39] Raw, dynamic, beautiful.

[12:41] And we got this from one of the simplest synthesizer in the market for free.

[12:45] Also you know what?

[12:46] This project is free.

[12:47] I'm gonna put on my Patreon.

[12:48] And you can download it for free there.

[12:50] I'm a sound designer.

[12:51] So I make outdoor preset packs.

[12:53] If you want to try my sounds like this.

[12:57] Or this.

[12:59] Or maybe even this.

[13:03] Maybe you find something.

[13:05] That imperfection is what makes them...
