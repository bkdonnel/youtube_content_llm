================================================================================

[00:01] Does this sound pure to you?

[00:04] No, it sounds plastic.

[00:05] It sounds like a calculator, not an instrument.

[00:08] This is because digital synths are mathematically perfect.

[00:11] And your brain hates perfection.

[00:15] It reads it as fake.

[00:17] The real instruments, they drift, they break, they struggle.

[00:21] That imperfection is what makes them expensive.

[00:24] So I took the cheapest, a free synthesizer and injected it with that imperfections.

[00:29] Listen one more time.

[00:38] They both are exactly the same free plugin.

[00:41] One of the simplest digital synths that you can ever get.

[00:44] The difference is this.

[00:45] The imperfection protocol.

[00:46] And let me show you why should you use it in your next sound.

[00:49] To make this work, I took one of the simplest synthesizers.

[00:52] This one is called KHS-1 from Kilohertz.

[00:55] They actually discontinued this plugin.

[00:57] But I wanted to have something very simple.

[01:00] And this is quite simple.

[01:01] So initial sound.

[01:05] Single oscillator, simple envelope.

[01:07] Everything else is turned off.

[01:09] This is as digital and plastic as it gets.

[01:12] Consider four things when you are making your sound more analog or authentic.

[01:17] The first one is source instability.

[01:19] That means making the oscillators or the source of your sound less stable.

[01:24] The first thing, introduce second oscillator.

[01:26] One octave down.

[01:27] Detune it slightly.

[01:29] Increase the gain.

[01:34] It's a bit muddy.

[01:35] Don't worry about it.

[01:36] We want that muddiness, that imperfection.

[01:38] But this is still too sterile.

[01:40] The thing I like to do, introducing a wobble.

[01:43] A pitch shift up and down.

[01:44] Making the sound coming from like a vintage synthesizer.

[01:47] Many ways to do this one.

[01:48] One of the simplest way, using echo.

[01:50] From sync to time.

[01:51] One month, 100% wet.

[01:52] And take off the filter.

[01:54] So it should basically doesn't change the sound.

[01:57] What happens is you go to wobble.

[02:04] If I can make it 100%, you can hear a bit better.

[02:07] Right?

[02:07] We don't want that much.

[02:08] And then I want a subtle noise, like a cassette noise.

[02:18] That subtle pitch drift.

[02:19] If you enjoyed the video up to now, please consider like and subscribe.

[02:22] And I promise I will make more videos like this.

[02:25] Number two.

[02:26] Reactive modulation.

[02:27] When you are playing an instrument, your touch, your pick.

[02:30] So that the volume and the character of the sound changes every single hit.

[02:34] How can we generate this in a simple synthesizer like this?

[02:37] You are in 2026 at least.

[02:40] That means that you have tools that you need inside your DAW.

[02:43] I'm gonna start with Envelope MIDI.

[02:45] You map the parameters that you want to modulate inside your synthesizers.

[02:49] For me, the most important parameters are filter decay.

[02:53] How fast filter moves back and forward.

[02:55] Amplitude decay.

[02:56] How fast the volume of the sound decays.

[02:58] Filter itself.

[02:59] The cutoff.

[02:59] How open the filter is.

[03:01] And filter envelope.

[03:02] How fast the filter moves.

[03:03] These four would already get you tons of different variation in your sound.

[03:07] You don't need to overcomplicate the things.

[03:09] To add that variation in perfection, I will start with the LFO.

[03:13] That will help you to move things around.

[03:15] Modulate the things.

[03:16] Then you click map and map each parameter on your synthesizer.

[03:20] Let's start with filter envelope.

[03:27] Can you feel the filter is opening?

[03:30] Look at here.

[03:32] Let's put it on the volume decay.

[03:40] And let's put it on the filter as well.

[03:50] Without.

[03:55] With.

[03:58] Can you hear the sound is breathing?

[04:00] But for me, we are just starting.

[04:02] I also want slower, longer movement on my cutoff.

[04:05] So that I can emphasize this building up.

[04:07] Another filter.

[04:08] The previous filter was just sine wave up and down.

[04:11] The next filter is on rate of one bar.

[04:14] So building, building up, going down.

[04:15] And we cannot jitter.

[04:16] So it's not perfect.

[04:17] Again, we like this type of mood.

[04:19] And I'm gonna put a bit smooth.

[04:21] Look at that.

[04:22] Looks very analog, isn't it?

[04:23] And on the cutoff.

[04:32] Suddenly, everything sounds much more analog.

[04:35] We are just starting.

[04:36] I want to emphasize those highs when I pluck the string.

[04:40] What can you do?

[04:41] Bring an envelope MIDI.

[04:42] We are simulating that pluck.

[04:44] Bring an equalizer.

[04:45] First slight curve.

[04:47] Just emphasize the lows and highs a bit.

[04:53] This is reactive modulation.

[04:55] This is a reflection of human playing instrument in digital domain.

[04:58] It's not every day a new plugin comes and impresses me.

[05:01] But today is not one of those days.

[05:03] Let me introduce you the Wingman.

[05:05] It's a new plugin from Mixing Key.

[05:07] And the idea is simple.

[05:08] A simple plugin that can help you build your chords, your melodies, your basses.

[05:13] Be a Wingman of yours in music production.

[05:15] Let's take a simple example.

[05:20] The way it works, you record your audio.

[05:23] Clicking this record.

[05:37] And it immediately, extremely fast,

[05:40] creates a chord progression for me that I can try out in the vocal.

[05:43] And a bass on top.

[05:45] So we have the bass and the chords.

[05:46] And if you play together, you'll hear.

[06:01] This was really a perfect chord progression for this vocal.

[06:04] And if you saw the bass, here's the bass.

[06:08] And this is the chords.

[06:12] Not only that, it creates actually different variations.

[06:15] So if you don't like the first one, you can scroll through.

[06:27] This is good too.

[06:28] So you can go through the different variations for your vocals.

[06:32] And pick the one that you enjoy.

[06:34] But it also does stamp separation.

[06:35] What does that mean?

[06:36] For example, let's try it on this one.

[06:41] Put it on the Wingman.

[06:43] Let's record this part.

[06:51] And we have immediately the vocals, instrument, bass and drums.

[07:02] This is very handy, especially if you want to come new ideas.

[07:05] Change the chord progression.

[07:06] So for example here, now we have this.

[07:15] Also you can create your chord progression based on different part of your stamps too.

[07:19] For example, if you're going to go after the bass.

[07:21] Then you can have completely chord progression made after the bass.

[07:32] And anytime you feel happy with anything.

[07:35] It's as easy as just pulling the midi and dropping down.

[07:38] Then you can actually change it the way you want.

[07:41] Pretty cool.

[07:42] It's a very cool plugin.

[07:43] So if you want to try it yourself.

[07:44] Check the links on the below.

[07:45] Three texture creation.

[07:47] We still have very clean sound.

[07:49] So we need type of a texture in the sound.

[07:52] So it feels even more natural.

[07:53] I like to start easy.

[07:55] Erosion on the high.

[07:56] And this will introduce this like noise like sound.

[08:06] But I also want dynamic saturation on top of that.

[08:10] We had already our envelope midi.

[08:12] What we need to do.

[08:13] Taking that.

[08:14] Putting a saturation.

[08:15] I'm using simple analog clip.

[08:16] And putting drive and drive wet into that envelope.

[08:19] So every hit creates a bit sudden saturation texture in the sound.

[08:31] Here's an A B.

[08:32] So you can hear how much difference we made.

[08:41] Without any effects on this.

[08:43] If you take this loop and give it to your analog obsessed friend.

[08:47] I guarantee you many of them would think this is analog sound.

[08:50] And tell you how they immediately understand it from the dynamics of the sound.

[08:54] The character.

[08:55] The saturation.

[08:56] This is something I like to do to my analog friends.

[08:59] And watch their faces afterwards.

[09:01] But this is not that.

[09:02] We need to put this into space now.

[09:04] The first.

[09:04] I want to give a bit stereo.

[09:06] I'm going to use auto pan.

[09:10] So this helps me with the dynamic positioning.

[09:13] But the main room feeling comes from a reverb.

[09:16] Any reverb you like.

[09:17] To keep it simple.

[09:18] Ableton's medium dark plate with 25%.

[09:20] The most important thing is actually cutting up a bit too low.

[09:23] So we don't mud it too much.

[09:25] And using it very subtly.

[09:28] So 21% wetness.

[09:33] This is the sound.

[09:34] So we are having a plate.

[09:42] Then I want a hole.

[09:44] So instant reflections from the plate.

[09:46] And bigger reflection from the hole simulation.

[09:48] This time we go for the return channel.

[09:51] So I can control the sound more.

[09:53] Send it there.

[09:54] So they solo the channel.

[09:56] See how big it is.

[10:03] And we are.

[10:06] Cleaning up all this high.

[10:09] So we have this much cleaner sound.

[10:13] Together.

[10:21] It's very subtle in the background.

[10:23] And then I want my delays.

[10:25] Up to now this sound is very focused in the middle.

[10:27] I intentionally didn't use any unison.

[10:29] Because I want to show you a single oscillator.

[10:32] Is oftentimes enough to get this really rich sound.

[10:35] But we do.

[10:36] Go to our second return channel.

[10:40] We have a ping pong delay.

[10:42] This is where the stereo is created.

[10:45] Move slightly and sidechain the sound itself.

[10:48] So we are ducking each times we play now.

[10:53] So this helps with not muddying the track.

[10:56] Together.

[11:04] Amazing.

[11:05] We haven't done it.

[11:06] I like to put also very fast delay.

[11:08] To just emphasize those stereos even more.

[11:10] Another send channel.

[11:11] This time we have very fast 1 16th slap delay with no feedback.

[11:19] This high side sound.

[11:22] Together.

[11:29] Now do you want cherry on top?

[11:31] A glue compression.

[11:32] This will make things even more glued together in the origin sound.

[11:41] Slow attack fast release.

[11:43] So we can let that those initial transients passively.

[11:45] True.

[11:55] And final piece in the puzzle.

[11:57] Is actually another filter.

[11:59] That you have your envelope on the filter frequency.

[12:02] So you can open and close the sound the way you like.

[12:12] And slight touches with the EQ.

[12:21] And look at this beautiful sound.

[12:38] Real dynamic beautiful.

[12:40] And we got this from one of the simplest synthesizer in the market for free.

[12:45] Also you know what?

[12:46] This project is free.

[12:47] I'm gonna put on my Patreon.

[12:48] And you can download it for free there.

[12:50] I'm a sound designer.

[12:51] So I make outdoor preset packs.

[12:53] If you want to try my sounds like this.

[12:57] Or this.

[12:59] Or maybe even this.

[13:03] Maybe you find something.

[13:04] That info...

[13:05] That imperfection is what makes them...
