================================================================================

[00:00] one of the Achilles heels for many producers making properly hard-hitting grooves

[00:12] I get it, it can be hard to understand the intricacies of a good hard-hitting groove

[00:17] but don't be afraid I'm here to hold your hand and show you how to make it

[00:27] the hard groove starts with a good kick where to find good kick for hard techno

[00:33] there is only one place this is where I get mine we have this

[00:37] I'm gonna make it shorter it kind of has this analog dirt

[00:41] it just makes it warmer and nicer to my taste let's do it four to the floor

[00:45] we are at 155 so really hard techno bpm now for this type of hard-hitting groove

[00:50] you have to build a bit of layer with your basses because they are really full

[00:54] and the way I like to start is always put first your sub bass and build upon it

[00:59] I actually don't like using rolling bass lines when it's so high in the bpm for the sub bass

[01:04] because there's not enough space to go up and down so we're gonna build one long sub bass

[01:12] for the sound be really minimal so we have this soft hood

[01:18] filter on top no effects whatsoever very simple however we want to have sidechain to the kick

[01:24] so make this transition here when the kick and sub hits smoother how do you do this we can use

[01:29] any sidechain plugin that you want because people were complaining that I'm using too much external

[01:34] effects this time we are making our decker inside Ableton we have the shaper automating the gain

[01:39] so basically sidechaining to the kick and a slight eq to make it a bit like darker and

[01:45] emptier in the middle the reason for this one is actually creating space for the layers that

[01:51] we are going to add on on this one you want a grit bass something with a lot of punch and body

[01:56] to grit the work you have to have a lot of distortion and you have to nail that in your

[02:01] face feeling first we have a sub hood and then another oscillator this is mostly for

[02:08] modulating this one a bit so right

[02:16] it gives this metallic character and the movement on the filter comes from this nice gradual

[02:23] increasing envelope and then what you need compress it oddity distort it and equalize it

[02:35] now if you play together they will sound a bit weird

[02:40] too bassy right remove all the low and just be the regular high pass

[02:45] I don't care too much about the face here if you're worried about the face you can just

[02:50] import utility and set and flip the faces it's really the same right it doesn't matter that

[03:00] much and then we're gonna use the ducker again to build that sucking in side to the kick effect

[03:08] however this is like a top bass this is the emin so we need a bit more

[03:12] whole feel on the background we can add a reverb chain so we have this whole thing

[03:17] and together now we have this

[03:22] if you feel like you're going to try this please consider like and subscribe and I promise I will

[03:26] make more videos like this for you now this actually can be many times already enough for a

[03:33] bass line in a hard track however in the parts where the drop comes in you want to have sometimes

[03:39] even more excitement so we will call this one the mean low end and then the rest we will call the

[03:45] aux basis so when you need that type of hard hitting part you can activate the aux basis

[03:50] to emphasize the groove and for the aux basis you actually really can go out of what you did

[03:55] in the low end itself in the low end we have this upbeat

[04:01] so good but we can put any rolling baseline or the release baseline whatever baseline you want

[04:05] on top of this because again it will be an octave up it will be more like a color but remember that

[04:12] if you have another baseline on top you again need to shave those tops a little bit more so

[04:17] there's a space on top of this so what i'm gonna do you can use eq like this

[04:24] and all that low and now kind of low pass and contained a little bit this one just gives me

[04:29] room for designing my high bass a bit better then you can adjust the eq depending on how you feel

[04:35] so let's go rolling baseline we're in the e just a regular rolling baseline now the sound is very

[04:41] important you want to sound bright and in your face and remember we are an octave up so if you

[04:47] just take a look at the eq you will see

[04:54] right 9365 even that part is not that loud so we are really focusing on those mid-low okay how to

[04:58] make sound again i'm keeping things but focusing on certain areas we have this it's from my forge

[05:04] pack by the way if you want to get rid of this type of aggressive sounds either take a look at

[05:08] my forge or verge techno packs they have like this type of tons of sounds but we have first this

[05:15] simple rolling important thing is having this very sharp envelope so it's very tight because

[05:20] we are rolling very fast at 155 bpm it's very fast and this long envelope on top

[05:29] and the noise part is important because noise will add now a little excitement

[05:35] and then we got the effects making it even more dynamic by automating

[05:41] high boost and low cut like this so it's like

[05:46] distorting even more even more by the tree and compressing it's so in your face to make this

[05:55] work even better than we have just a slight eq and then of course sidechain the kick but this

[06:00] time your sidechain is not that aggressive we are letting the initial path a little bit trip so it's

[06:07] together now we have this

[06:13] without the ekey cut that we did you see that the sounds will combine a bit too much

[06:18] the way in a track that actually use this you start the track like this without the rolling

[06:23] bass line like this and in the climax in the part that you really need end of energy then

[06:30] you low pass this part and activate the aux places we are not done now we can make it even

[06:38] more crazier more aggressive by kind of finding sample or utilizing another really high-end

[06:44] screech type of sound i have this sample over here this is only the process so there's nothing to do

[06:49] but the idea is more important we have this type of very screechy sound and this is gonna make

[06:55] things even crazier again this sits quite high when you activate

[07:03] if you know my channel i don't actually like to build my bases this way but

[07:07] genres are different and considering genre specific techniques are important so i wouldn't

[07:12] make a melodic techno love and like this but i will definitely go for creating this type of very

[07:16] hard hitting techno grooves right the one thing that you can do actually if you want to make the

[07:21] even more in your face you can take that kick and put it on the off beat and actually smooth it out

[07:29] a little bit so that the initial bump a bit softer so it's a bit also sucking effect and

[07:34] low pass it very hard so you have this kind of almost tom like effect to emphasize

[07:40] the kind of pumping feel even more like this

[07:44] do you hear that well it's very subtle you can make it of course less subtle almost like a rumble

[07:49] but much more defined and in your face rumble in this case but it's up to you it's not a must

[07:55] but it is something that i do really enjoy in a track like this so like this now in a club this

[08:00] hits super hard but of course for a groove you need the drums now don't exaggerate your drums

[08:05] if you want to go for this type of rich bass we are not making shrugs so there is not so much

[08:10] industrial drums in this one we are making more like main room hard techno style so there will

[08:15] most of the times we either have vocals or melodies or synths on this so you need to give

[08:20] space to them let's start with a simple clap it'll be the reverb on top again see how much

[08:26] i'm actually high passing the sound again we have so much things going on i want to cut out

[08:32] as much as space possible in the mid area

[08:39] distortion and a slight compression now we have this

[08:46] and for the high hats now this is the place you can do quite many cool tricks to be honest

[08:52] we will start with the 16 hat the sound itself is very simple and we have slight groove on it

[08:57] but we will create even more groove but first adding a velocity randomness this will just

[09:02] increase the randomness of each hit but then i'm gonna get a shaper

[09:08] and add this in the volume so it's kind of creating side turn kick feel

[09:13] but not really it has this kind of nice groove on top

[09:20] right and then we got controls and we random pan so it's also panning right left as well so this

[09:27] will add a lot of space and depth immediately to the groove that you have without almost taking

[09:32] no space whatsoever especially when you like excite the highs a little bit more listen to this

[09:42] do you see how immediately it opens up the mix without

[09:49] this is due to the human hearings focusing much more in the mids and high mids when it

[09:55] comes to stereo image so we immediately realized how spacious it gets when you do this trick but

[10:00] this is not enough i want more groove what do we do we get zero keep the 16 style we create

[10:06] very short envelope but then we take lfo2 like we did with the shaper and put it on the level

[10:12] more importantly we also put it on decay so this will lead to kind of this opening up

[10:16] getting bigger hi-hat feel and this is a noise so it is just there to excite the track listen

[10:25] right it's one of the simplest way to actually excite your head and add movement to them listen

[10:30] now you don't feel like there are two hats it feels like one hat is opening you can do this

[10:38] by automating decay as well but i feel like when you do with the white noise it feels the high end

[10:44] spectrum a bit more it excites a bit more now listen again immediately groove starts to leave

[10:54] and final step is of course just emphasizing those off hats so we have this like

[11:01] feel for that again we utilize relish to add a bit of randomness but this time if you take a look we

[11:08] have this layering going on here with this and then we just have this excellent hats to just

[11:15] make it a bit groovier together we turn into this

[11:29] i'm of course adding quite a bit of distortion on top

[11:33] and again exciting this area and such subtle compression this is actually sent to plate reverb

[11:41] here all drums are sent to plate reverb to create this room feeling

[11:49] they sit beautifully in a room

[11:54] and final step is just adding a drone you can use anything for this one this is really

[11:58] tasting this coming from my silk preset pack it's just like this

[12:04] whooing drone sound it fits to this track because we have this kind of i don't know how to explain

[12:09] whooing vibe in whole track

[12:14] the one thing that you can do you can duplicate this and create actually a bit more like a

[12:19] turnarounds with your kicks by utilizing this type of hits for example here at around

[12:24] four bar we are doing a turnaround just exciting the track a bit

[12:31] and all together now we have this gorgeous groove going on

[12:37] the one thing that i like to do oftentimes actually add a bit saturation and limiting

[12:41] to the low end group just to catch the low ends peaks and glue them a bit together like this

[12:48] and you can do the very similar things with your drums as well

[12:52] and then we have this really glued together perfection

[13:04] this is actually groove of the template that i created for hard techno producers

[13:20] but if you want to stay here and learn more about techno production i have a

[13:25] take a look
