    "text": "You are here for a ride today. One of these is louder than other. Can you hear it? So how can you make something clearly louder without turning it up? If you are looking at compressors or the volume faders, don't. This is what I call phantom loudness. It is created by adding something your ears can hear, but your meters barely can see. You are watching my series if you can learn one music production trick today, learn this. And today we learn phantom loudness. This is a visualization that I built for you. This illustrates really nice. This is the amount of extra colors that you add with saturation. These are bass, body and lead. The good thing about saturation is you can decide how much you can add. How many extra bubbles there will be inside your jars and instrument. And this add a little bit saturation. Bubbles, extras inside those jars. So what happens? These bubbles, saturation add up. Leading to this much more colorful, fuller jar. Hence the phantom loudness. Listen to this. Gorgeous right? But it lacks a bit of loudness, a bit fullness, a bit depth. And all this can be achieved with single trick. And this is the targeted saturation to achieve the phantom loudness. I'm gonna copy exactly the same loop here. And we're gonna attack each element to create certain enhancement. First, long end. I want to glue bass and kick, but also a bit oomph by adding saturation. I know some people complain that I use a lot of different audio effects plugins, but the reason for this, I really want to show you my own workflow. The things that I use every day. So you don't feel I am hiding information from you okay? For this one, we're gonna go low. Pentode sounds a bit too dirty for low end. So we're gonna bring down the pentode and try out, but keep saturation. Without. With. If you think you're gonna try this, please consider like and subscribe. And I promise I will make more videos like this. And we can always check our peaks. So we keep the same peaks okay? Without. With. If anything, we are actually a bit below the previous peak level. You hear how subtle it is. It doesn't matter. You will see how much difference it will make later. Then we have percussion group. Sounds like this. Now for this one, I'm gonna use roar. So that I can use stereo saturation. Stage one. Stage two. Compress a bit. Let's adjust the levels by output here. For the hats, I really liked this sizzle feel of exciter from Ozone. I'm gonna oversample. This is another reason I use actually on this one on the hats. Retro. And the rest tried. Adjust the peaks. And you have these pads. Only thing that I can think is tape. This wobbly tape sound on top. Without tape. With tape. Yep. Same. Now there is also high bells, but high bells already has a bit pedals on them. So they are quite distortions. Again, we only add the saturation at the places we think it will make difference. Even though it is subtle. And my final take is adding glue saturation on top of everything. We are on the flat saturation. Time to tone down a little bit. Try it. And bring the mix to something like this. So it's a parallel saturation. Adjust the peaks one more time. Without. With. Again, our peaks are actually less than before. Moment of truth. Let's do an A B. And to make sure that we are in the same saturation levels. Original. Saturated. So we see. Saturated. Original. Here how not only the loudness changed, but perceived depth of the track also changed. And things started sound cleaner. And less A B now. The old version almost sounds like claustrophobic, isn't it?
