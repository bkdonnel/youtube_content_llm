================================================================================

[00:00] Deep house is one of those genres that you appreciate as you grow older,

[00:04] so today we are going to make a deep house like Pyrrhos, like this.

[00:31] When it comes to deep house, there are many ways to do it, and to be honest,

[00:34] I like each one of them, but today I want to do the cream and butter version deep house,

[00:39] like we will have a vocal, we will track around it and play for the vibes.

[00:44] When I start, I always start with at least a chord progression type of thing, but starting

[00:49] with the kick and bass progression really helps a lot, so we will start like that.

[00:53] For the kick, I like smooth kicks, I have a whole pack about it, but pick something like this.

[01:00] It is a mid-long kick, and we are gonna actually brighten up slightly,

[01:05] right? Depending on the bass actually, you can shorten it a bit more, but we will see about that.

[01:09] And for the deep house, I really like this like kick-thumb type of groove,

[01:13] the way I like to do it, just tilt your kick sample, shorten it out, keep it short,

[01:18] and then just use an EQ to take like this mid-low part of the sound, so that you have this like

[01:23] warm sound, but still transient enough, so that it can pop in the mix.

[01:28] The placement doesn't matter, I prefer to put them on the off-beat, like this.

[01:35] You can build any pattern you like.

[01:38] For the bass, I like this kind of perfect fifth layered bass sounds a lot in deep house,

[01:44] I think it gives a whole ton of a vibe.

[01:47] We are in the D sharp minor, so let's start with eight bass, but that means there is just

[01:52] eight basses in a bar, that dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.

[01:55] It's another rolling bass, so it will give more like a smoother feeling.

[01:58] So we have this now.

[02:01] So it is kind of a big sound, but let me explain a bit more.

[02:05] So the sound-wise, if I turn these two off, we will just have ours up.

[02:10] This gives this up, so this is the reason that the sound will be relatively stable,

[02:15] but that harmonic feel on the sound comes from these two.

[02:20] If I solo this one, this is like one octave up, and this is in the same octave.

[02:26] So what happens is, we are using sync to get those upper harmonics,

[02:30] the power harmonics of the sound, like here.

[02:33] Let me just solo these two, so you can actually hear the effect of only one note sound.

[02:41] Right?

[02:43] And here around, and then we do the same thing over here.

[02:46] Let me turn this off, so you can hear this.

[02:49] This is much higher, and this gives that this signature deep house bass sound.

[02:54] Listen to this now.

[02:56] If we go to effects, we have a distortion, chorus, combo, hyperdynamic.

[03:03] This is coming from my SILK preset pack.

[03:05] There is really, really, really nice deep house basses there.

[03:08] And another important thing is that we have the soft envelope on cutoff.

[03:14] And also the volume envelope has this slight decay.

[03:18] So we have this really strong sound, right?

[03:20] This is the core of the sound.

[03:22] We have of course on unison on top layers to open up the sound on the sides.

[03:28] But the sound is a bit stereo too.

[03:29] And then from there we want to open up space for the kick.

[03:32] So I'm using DAC for it.

[03:33] You can use any sidechain tool that you like.

[03:38] Now the main reason I'm using Saturn here is not really that much of distortion,

[03:41] but pushing those upper harmonics up.

[03:43] You see this is pulled up around 4 dB.

[03:46] So these like mid highs.

[03:49] Right?

[03:50] This really pushes that feel.

[03:53] And we are on the linear phase to keep the phase intact.

[03:57] And finally you could even more boosting.

[03:59] This is a signature deep house bass.

[04:02] This is like everywhere.

[04:03] And I love this sound for it.

[04:08] Now I like to layer this with another higher bass layer.

[04:12] The way I like to use that oftentimes in deep house is actually,

[04:15] start with the simple bass layer,

[04:17] and then an additional high layer with the verses and choruses

[04:20] to add a bit dimension to the bass itself.

[04:23] The way we are going to do it actually taking exactly the same sound,

[04:26] but removing this sub.

[04:27] And put this one octave above.

[04:29] So we have now this.

[04:31] Right?

[04:35] And together this turn into this.

[04:38] And then you always control how much you will add that upper layer with just mixing.

[04:49] It can become a bit too much when the bass is alone.

[04:53] But when the layers comes in the percussions, the kicks,

[04:56] or the snares, the vocals,

[04:57] you will hear how much difference this can make.

[05:00] Now when it comes to bass,

[05:01] what I like to do,

[05:02] I need kind of a bass progression to kind of at least inspire me or something.

[05:06] If you feel like you're gonna try this,

[05:08] please consider like and subscribe.

[05:10] So I can show you more of these.

[05:11] Let's start with the classic 640.

[05:13] Meaning that if we take a look at our root key, D sharp.

[05:17] 6 means that 6, not a bow.

[05:19] Like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

[05:21] And then you go to 4th.

[05:22] And then you go back to the root.

[05:23] This will create this kind of decreasing tension, relaxing feeling.

[05:26] It's a very deep house thing, right?

[05:27] Now we have this.

[05:33] With the kick.

[05:41] That immediate burst of deep house feeling.

[05:45] Now, when I make this type of tracks,

[05:47] the tracks has to evolve around the vocals.

[05:51] Hence, I like to bring the vocals as early as possible.

[05:54] You can either use the samples from Splice,

[05:57] your vocalist friends, AI, whatever you like.

[05:59] In this case, I want Splice.

[06:01] I'm hunting and found this.

[06:14] That's it.

[06:15] And I think for a deep house track,

[06:17] you oftentimes don't even need more than this.

[06:20] Because you want repetition and you want hookiness.

[06:23] And this is very hooky vocal.

[06:24] Maybe on the breakdown, you can use some ad-libs.

[06:27] But for me, for this type of tracks, this is really good.

[06:31] The only thing that I don't like,

[06:32] and this is a very common producer pitfall,

[06:35] is like producers will put like this.

[06:40] For me, it is so obvious.

[06:42] Like the vocal is actually recorded as it is.

[06:45] But I think the beat should come after the first bar.

[06:49] Like this.

[06:52] Do you hear it?

[06:53] It is so obvious.

[06:54] At least for me.

[06:55] So when you are picking vocals,

[06:57] like try to really listen where the beat should sink into the vocal.

[07:00] Like when you do this.

[07:05] You are elevating that.

[07:06] I cannot stress this enough.

[07:07] Like when I say this, really try to really pay attention.

[07:10] You're a composer.

[07:11] And your job is to elevate the elements that you are using.

[07:15] Especially the main elements.

[07:16] In this type of tracks, the vocals.

[07:18] I know a lot of producers think that they are producers.

[07:20] They have to find the best leads or sounds.

[07:23] No.

[07:24] As a producer, your job is,

[07:26] when you have the vocals like this,

[07:28] elevate the main theme as much as possible.

[07:31] Right?

[07:31] And for me, this.

[07:35] That down in it, drown in it.

[07:37] It is the thing.

[07:38] It is the hook.

[07:38] So how we can elevate?

[07:40] Of course, just move that.

[07:41] And this immediately gives me an idea.

[07:42] Because now I'm thinking,

[07:44] oh wait, this could be an extremely good intro.

[07:47] Why?

[07:48] Because let's move this a bit more here now.

[07:50] And then I can bring immediately.

[07:53] Forget that kick.

[07:54] Bring that bass in.

[07:55] So like this.

[07:59] Oh my god.

[08:00] Immediately.

[08:01] 

[08:01] Now, when you have ideas like this.

[08:03] And hopefully you will have it.

[08:04] Like when you find the right things.

[08:06] And you get into the right flow.

[08:07] It will click like this.

[08:08] You will like, oh that or this and that.

[08:11] And arrangement resolves itself.

[08:13] That gives me immediately.

[08:14] I want to build that intro now.

[08:15] Because now I can make a really catchy intro.

[08:17] To grab attention of my listeners.

[08:19] Now I have the things that I need to have.

[08:21] But I need to create the ambience.

[08:24] To give that deep house.

[08:26] That deep ethereal ambience for the listeners.

[08:29] But the first thing I think is of course the pads.

[08:32] Let's bring those pads.

[08:33] Let's create pads.

[08:34] I really feel like organic sounds.

[08:37] Like guitars or guitar-like sounds.

[08:39] Or like organ-like sounds.

[08:40] Like the sounds that you will hear it in organic music.

[08:43] Really adds a depth and layer for this channel.

[08:46] So this preset that I found.

[08:47] Again coming from Silk Preset Pack.

[08:49] I cannot stress enough.

[08:50] This is one of the best packs you can find for.

[08:52] Mediocre House and Deep House.

[08:53] The idea is like simple.

[08:54] Finding this kind of organic sound.

[08:56] This was by the way another spectral.

[08:59] But I was just scrolling through.

[09:00] Just find more guitar-like sounds.

[09:02] So we have this.

[09:02] This is just only thing that I changed in this patch.

[09:08] So we are holding that guitar sound.

[09:16] And adding bunch of effects.

[09:18] To create this really deep haunting ambience.

[09:22] And a bit EQ.

[09:23] Cut that super lows out.

[09:25] So it's more like even drone.

[09:27] And then sidechain the kick.

[09:29] Slightly.

[09:32] Gorgeous.

[09:33] Really gorgeous.

[09:33] Now what it hits me.

[09:34] Is like oh my god my vocal is dry.

[09:37] I want this big deep house vocals on top.

[09:39] Before I do that.

[09:40] I'm gonna make one more pad.

[09:41] Because I know when the vocals comes in.

[09:43] It will take too much space.

[09:44] Creating this simple elegant sounds under it.

[09:46] It's harder when you have big vocals.

[09:48] So let's get another string-like pad here.

[09:50] And remember I'm just playing one single note.

[09:53] And it is the root key D sharp.

[09:55] We can also sometimes play the fifth, third.

[09:57] But now I think to make the focus on the vocals.

[10:00] This is more than enough.

[10:00] And we have this sound now.

[10:01] Again of course you know it coming from Silk.

[10:04] This is more like a.

[10:07] More airy.

[10:08] More like stringy.

[10:09] Little bit vocally.

[10:10] So together they are like this.

[10:15] Right?

[10:15] And this in turns into this.

[10:21] Drowning it.

[10:23] Is it enough?

[10:24] No.

[10:24] Because we need to work on our vocal now.

[10:26] The deep house vocal standard is less airy, beautiful.

[10:29] What is the right word for this?

[10:31] Like majestic right?

[10:32] Majestic is right.

[10:33] So how do we do this?

[10:34] We have a single vocal.

[10:35] We don't have any extra take.

[10:36] So we need to create everything from single vocals.

[10:38] You can use AI.

[10:39] I have videos about that.

[10:40] But I'm gonna do it the old school way now.

[10:42] I'm gonna start with the timeless.

[10:44] I like the way you're going down on it.

[10:47] I know it's very like a big and interfering a bit with the main vocal.

[10:51] To decrease that we are ducking a little bit.

[10:53] This is the timeless own feature.

[10:55] Otherwise we have to put a sidechain compression on top of itself.

[10:58] So that it ducks the effect when the vocal comes in.

[11:02] And then we can have a huge reverb.

[11:05] I'm using vintage reverb.

[11:09] This classic long tail reverb right on top of the vocal.

[11:13] Now we have these really airy vocals here.

[11:16] And I want to dump a little bit here.

[11:21] The support is we are gonna actually duplicate the same vocals.

[11:24] But we are going to use chorus as introducing that slight pitch shift.

[11:29] And pushing the sound a bit side.

[11:30] So that there is a depth and full listeners there more than one vocals.

[11:34] But simply the same vocals we are using chorus D.

[11:37] I like this one because I think this works really well on vocals.

[11:40] And 100% with.

[11:42] Now we have this.

[11:42] I like the way you're going down.

[11:44] Vocal really push to the sides.

[11:46] I like the way you're going down.

[11:48] And now when it comes to the effects.

[11:50] It really depends on what you want.

[11:51] You can really use it as dry as well.

[11:53] Because we blend them.

[11:54] I like the way you're going down in it.

[11:57] Down in it.

[11:59] Drown in it.

[12:01] Without.

[12:01] I like the way you're going down in it.

[12:05] Down in it.

[12:06] It's really good isn't it.

[12:08] That's the reason I really like that specific plugin from Arturia.

[12:11] It just works amazing.

[12:12] Depending on your feel.

[12:14] Depending on how it sounds in your track.

[12:16] You can add even those sides a bit reverb.

[12:18] The main thing I like to do oftentimes.

[12:21] I like the way you're going down in it.

[12:22] Into is a bit of overdrive.

[12:23] I like the way you're going down in it.

[12:25] So glue those two vocals into each other.

[12:28] I like the way you're going down in it.

[12:32] Down in it.

[12:33] This is something that we are going to show later.

[12:35] And let's see how it sounds right.

[12:37] Again don't use too much effects if it doesn't need it.

[12:40] Let's listen.

[12:41] I like the way you're going down in it.

[12:44] Down in it.

[12:46] Drown in it.

[12:48] I like the way you go.

[12:50] Now our work with the vocal doesn't end here.

[12:53] So I'm immediately feeling like I don't like this part coming again.

[12:56] I want to hold that down in it, around in it, that part longer.

[12:59] So we're just gonna copy that part.

[13:02] Down in it.

[13:04] Down in it.

[13:06] Drown in it.

[13:08] Right.

[13:08] Going, going, going, going.

[13:10] Hold that going going here.

[13:12] Going, going, down in it, down in it, hey.

[13:17] Drown in it.

[13:20] Going, going, going, going.

[13:22] Right. There you go.

[13:23] The track build.

[13:24] This what I mean.

[13:24] This type of tracks really builds themselves.

[13:27] And there's really kind of joy to make them.

[13:29] But I'm feeling like now when the second part comes in here.

[13:32] Going, going, down in it.

[13:34] Here's the part that we start to build a bit with maybe percussions.

[13:37] Like making that change.

[13:38] You can put simple hats here.

[13:41] Again eight hats.

[13:43] We don't need to rush anything.

[13:45] Like this.

[13:47] Shaper box adds this dirt on it.

[13:49] Without it.

[13:50] With.

[13:53] A bit EQ.

[13:54] And finally duck.

[13:58] Do it slightly to making a bit more on beat, off beat feeling a bit more obvious.

[14:02] Slightly ducking here right.

[14:03] I want kind of this like organic percussion style sound on top of this too.

[14:08] So a type of rip sound.

[14:10] So we have this.

[14:13] I want to clip a bit slightly.

[14:17] Remove that love and mud.

[14:20] And do the same thing over here.

[14:22] Adding a bit noise on top.

[14:23] So it sounds more organic.

[14:25] Distort it.

[14:30] Clip one more time.

[14:34] And regain.

[14:36] Now we have this.

[14:45] And then I actually like to build a verse.

[14:48] We can just duplicate what we have.

[14:50] Like this right.

[14:55] And remove these vocals.

[14:57] I think we can layer the hats a bit more.

[15:00] Like a 16 type of hats on top.

[15:02] But just following that kind of sound.

[15:05] Rather than just straight 16.

[15:10] But it adds to the groove.

[15:19] And we make ad-libs from the vocals.

[15:22] Like take those vocals.

[15:23] Copy them here.

[15:28] Right.

[15:29] And then because the vocals are so strong.

[15:32] We want to like get this.

[15:34] Build this verse.

[15:35] Get into the vocal.

[15:36] And then get into the maybe arpeggio or something like that.

[15:39] So what you can do.

[15:40] Duplicate this one.

[15:41] Put in the vocals.

[15:41] And then duplicate one more.

[15:43] And build and delete.

[15:44] So we are kind of ABing stuff around.

[15:47] That means that now we have here.

[15:58] Remember that when we do have those switch or turnaround points.

[16:02] We kind of like.

[16:03] I like to remove the kick set this in some parts.

[16:05] It may be double kick over here.

[16:09] Right.

[16:09] And high passing the low end in parts.

[16:14] So that turnaround.

[16:18] Gets a bit stronger.

[16:19] Also you would like to support them with the transition effects.

[16:22] Like here.

[16:22] I'm already feeling like at the entry here.

[16:24] You can probably put some like a white noise.

[16:27] Reverse cymbal.

[16:27] So things like this right.

[16:29] Here when the vocal comes in.

[16:30] Reverse cymbal.

[16:31] Coming from my effects pack.

[16:32] And then like a downshift there.

[16:36] So it is more like emphasized.

[16:41] Right.

[16:42] And kind of a build up here with the reverse.

[16:46] Again everything coming from my effects pack.

[16:54] To be honest this downlift is even maybe too much.

[16:56] But it's also a bit genre thing.

[16:58] It is used widely.

[16:59] The final touch is actually now building.

[17:02] Kind of the secondary hook.

[17:03] Secondary hook in deep houses.

[17:05] Oftentimes something almost as strong as vocals.

[17:08] But that will carry the track.

[17:10] Especially if you go for like pop stylish arrangement.

[17:13] So you have this AB sections where the hook changes.

[17:17] Or there are like two separate hooks that can actually keep people listening.

[17:20] The reason for this that in pop music you really want to keep people engaged all the time.

[17:24] In electronic dance music we have more relaxed arrangement.

[17:26] And deep house especially if you go for this vocal direction.

[17:30] I feel like it really enjoys that poppish arrangement style.

[17:33] If you want to keep people a bit more engaged.

[17:35] So for me you can use anything.

[17:37] But I like synthesizers.

[17:38] I'm a sound designer.

[17:40] So my idea over here is what if we go for like a chords.

[17:43] I enjoy also this kind of happy chords.

[17:45] What you do now is actually take that chord progression that we have right.

[17:50] And go for this dotted progression.

[17:52] Like here what we are doing basically.

[17:54] We are using same progression but adding the second note.

[17:57] Here the fifth, fifth, fifth.

[17:58] And at the end of the turnaround just introduce something else to add a bit drama.

[18:02] So how does this sound?

[18:03] It sounds like this.

[18:13] Right it's it's like a very deep house.

[18:15] Like this is something you would hear a lot.

[18:17] For the sound wise I'm just leaving a couple of different presets.

[18:21] You can either go for this kind of more fuller sound.

[18:23] Let me show the other one first as well.

[18:25] This type of more gentle sound as well.

[18:28] This will work too.

[18:29] Let me let me play for you.

[18:35] Right but for this one I'm a more bigger sound girl.

[18:40] So I like a bit bigger sounds.

[18:42] Main idea is this.

[18:45] Right it's kind of it's like a super sobby.

[18:50] Short pluck sound on top of high plucky sound.

[18:57] And one ambient style sound.

[19:02] So together they create this kind of really cool full sound.

[19:08] And we have duck on it to sidechain the kick.

[19:11] And a big vintage reverb.

[19:15] Creating this washed out.

[19:16] Because we had this vocal with the big wash out and we're giving up the same vibe here too.

[19:23] And this really switch up the vibes a lot.

[19:25] If you especially support this was kind of build up.

[19:38] Kind of really natural builds up into the sound.

[19:41] As usual this is available on my Patreon.

[19:43] If you want to go deeper and really study everything.

[19:45] Feel free to go check out there.

[19:47] Unfortunately remove the supply sound.

[19:49] Because I don't have rights to distribute that.

[19:51] But the rest will be there.

[19:52] If you have supplies you can download the same vocal.

[19:54] And just put it there and you will have it okay.

[21:00] Now we learned that you can take a look at here.

[21:03] This is also cool.
