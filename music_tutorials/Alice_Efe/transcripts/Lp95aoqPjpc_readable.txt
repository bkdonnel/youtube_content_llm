================================================================================

[00:00] In a second, you will listen the same loop, but with a different tension lever.

[00:18] Can you spot the difference in the energy?

[00:20] There is one skill that separates top one person producers from everybody else.

[00:24] It is not sound design, it's not mixing, it's not mastering.

[00:27] It is the secret to create energy and controlling the energy in their arrangements.

[00:32] Later in this video, I will also show off the number one biggest mistake most intermediate

[00:36] and beginner producers make too.

[00:38] Hint, it's about fake tension.

[00:40] This might be my most valuable video yet, so hop in.

[00:45] Tension levers are tools that help you change the energy levels in your track.

[00:50] They will come in many forms, but we will go each one of them.

[00:53] The first one is called dance the levers.

[00:55] The idea is simple, if we increase the density of information, we will feel the urgency.

[01:00] The simplest example is percussion density.

[01:02] Listen to this.

[01:05] Classic 4 to the floor beat.

[01:07] The simplest way to increase the energy would be actually changing how dense the percussion

[01:12] rhythm is.

[01:12] Now, let's play a 16th note and hear a difference.

[01:20] Low density.

[01:22] High density.

[01:24] Immediate jump in an energy.

[01:26] This is what I call beat density, and easiest way to implement in your tracks, but it doesn't

[01:30] only applies to the percussions.

[01:32] The second dance lever is syncopation.

[01:40] We could syncopate this melody, increase the density and increase the energy.

[01:45] So all the red notes is syncopation, increasing the density of the note hits.

[01:56] How to use this?

[01:57] You can use this around turnarounds, to change the energy from one part of your track to

[02:02] the next part of your track.

[02:03] Listen.

[02:06] Let's build up.

[02:15] So simple, yet so elegant.

[02:17] Dance the levers is not only about adding, but it could be removing too.

[02:21] Listen to this.

[02:29] How can we remove and make it more dense?

[02:33] 

[02:33] Gates can add rhythm by removing some parts of the track.

[02:37] Let's take a look at this infiltrator.

[02:39] It is basically creating three hits from a sustained sound in case it's our vocal.

[02:43] Listen.

[02:49] From here.

[02:51] If you can add a bit of air, and a bit echo, so there are a couple of hits on the sides,

[02:57] ping pong, and a bit shimmery reverb, afterwards you will end up even more energy like this.

[03:03] Now listen how much this elevates the energy of track without adding anything.

[03:16] From here.

[03:22] Cool, isn't it?

[03:23] While we are at gates, the LFOs, those are cool, those can work very similar.

[03:28] Listen to this.

[03:35] Cool, but what if we wanted to increase the energy?

[03:38] What could be done?

[03:39] Simple, LFOs.

[03:40] LFOs are basically tools to apply certain waveform into selected parameters.

[03:46] In this case, if we take the same LFO and apply it on the cutoff filter, we will end up with this.

[03:53] With the 8.

[03:54] And the rate will define how often we replay the wave modulation, right?

[03:59] You see?

[04:01] From here.

[04:03] To here.

[04:04] We can still keep it off-beat feel, creating this slight ducking effect with the kick.

[04:09] Without.

[04:10] With.

[04:12] And now, listen how much that changes the energy of the track.

[04:17] From here.

[04:20] To here.

[04:26] These are dance the levers.

[04:28] If you are enjoying the video, please consider like and subscribe, and I promise, I will make more videos like this for you.

[04:33] So time to go to next one, which is color levers.

[04:36] The levers are so hard word, oh my god.

[04:39] The color tilt means density of frequency in different bands.

[04:46] The track that is dancer here will be more energetic than the track that is dancer on the left side.

[04:52] How can you use that?

[04:53] First example, color tilting your build-ups.

[04:56] This is a track that I've worked with Andrea, and will be released very soon.

[05:07] To be fair, energy is very high already.

[05:10] But I want more.

[05:11] Because when I play this track in the club, I know how people reacts when things go up and up and up.

[05:16] And energy goes up and up and up.

[05:18] And you build this huge expectation.

[05:20] Remember that tilt EQ?

[05:21] All you need to do, get it around, somewhere around here that you like.

[05:24] It doesn't really matter that much where exactly you put it.

[05:27] And what you do, just automate the gain.

[05:29] So it tilts more and more and more when it's going up.

[05:38] Basically shifting the frequency response of your song.

[05:42] Let me A B so you can hear how much difference it makes.

[05:45] Without.

[05:49] With.

[05:57] 

[06:03] Don't tell me that drop was hype.

[06:06] This track is coming in a month, so let me know if you want more tutorials about it.

[06:10] EQs are cool, but you don't need to always use them to tilt the frequency balance.

[06:14] Cymbals, and using cymbals as lever can be very handy.

[06:17] Listen to this.

[06:22] That drop was terrible.

[06:24] Because it lacked energy.

[06:25] What if we take a simple cry sound.

[06:27] And build energy with cymbal hit.

[06:29] Like this.

[06:30] And drop into another cymbal.

[06:33] Filling up to super high, so tilting the frequency response.

[06:35] Anything would work.

[06:36] I love rides.

[06:37] I am a drummer.

[06:38] I played in rock bands.

[06:40] That ride thing is my thing, okay?

[06:44] We have this.

[06:47] It's more like splashy ride, but it doesn't matter.

[06:49] This is really very high sound, right?

[06:51] Very concentrated on the high end.

[06:53] So we are tilting the frequency response.

[06:56] And together now we have this.

[07:02] Without.

[07:05] That's a huge energy difference, but it's just single element.

[07:09] That also gives the groove to the track.

[07:11] It's a real hack.

[07:12] But sometimes you don't want to use crash.

[07:14] Another lever is actually using white noise as a high end tool.

[07:18] How do you do that?

[07:19] Let's take a white noise.

[07:20] I am using Serum's noise generator.

[07:21] The problem is the white noise is not that white.

[07:25] What we do?

[07:26] Like we learned.

[07:27] Tilt it.

[07:27] Now it is much more whiter and brighter.

[07:29] You can literally see we change the slope of the white noise.

[07:33] Add duck to emphasize the groove.

[07:35] So that it's not just like simple noise on top.

[07:37] And a bit shimmer reverb so we can feel the room or the hole too.

[07:41] And let's remove that cymbal and try the same thing with noise.

[07:44] Without.

[07:47] With.

[07:51] Cool.

[07:52] Color levers are cool, but you can be a bit more avant-garde and use pitch levers.

[07:57] Humans feel anxious or feel urgency when the pitch of the things goes up.

[08:12] Love this animation.

[08:13] You can abuse this in your tracks and use to create tension and energy.

[08:17] The simplest way to do this would actually octave jumping your melody.

[08:21] This is a tutorial from two weeks ago.

[08:23] If you haven't seen it, check it out.

[08:24] It's about different moods and modes of techno.

[08:27] It's a very cool video.

[08:28] We have this melody.

[08:31] If you shift this melody one octave up, it will feel more dramatic.

[08:38] You can use this as your advantage between different verses of your track.

[08:43] To create a drama, create tension.

[08:45] Listen to this.

[08:52] Drama.

[08:53] 

[08:53] Change.

[08:54] Immediate tension.

[08:55] Even though the trick is super simple.

[08:56] This can apply to vocals too.

[08:59] Listen to these vocals.

[09:00] We are at the breakdown.

[09:01] We are trying to build energy.

[09:07] This is the changeover.

[09:09] Coming to the final part of the build up.

[09:15] Of course, everything else is changing the drama, but the vocals need to add the drama too.

[09:20] Now, there is another take.

[09:21] Just use the perfect fifth often times back.

[09:24] Raising the pitch a little bit in certain phrases.

[09:26] Goes like this.

[09:31] And this adds to the drama of the vocal.

[09:37] And listen how immediate drama adds in when the second vocal's pitched up comes in.

[09:49] Cool, isn't it?

[09:50] But vocals are maybe not your thing.

[09:52] You can do this even in your basses with your passing notes.

[09:55] This is just offbeat bassline with a groove.

[10:05] Boris Brejcha would approve this groove.

[10:08] By the way, all these things are on my Patreon.

[10:11] I give these to my Patreon followers so that they can download and play around.

[10:15] And this groove alone, I think, worth to join my Patreon.

[10:20] But you decide.

[10:21] The simplest way to create tension and change around points like here.

[10:25] Here we have two bars.

[10:26] Another two bars would be actually giving bass to octave jumps.

[10:30] Here we are in E0.

[10:31] We are jumping E1.

[10:32] And in the second or at the end of four bar, we are actually jumping twice.

[10:36] E1 first, E2 afterwards.

[10:38] So it will be like this.

[10:40] And then.

[10:41] This is called passing notes because they are just right before the passing to the new bar.

[10:46] And they are very short often times.

[10:47] It's a tiny trick but can really add a lot to your track.

[10:50] Listen here now.

[10:58] Super cool.

[10:59] There is also a method of utilizing harmonies and playing around the notes to create tension.

[11:05] These are called harmonic levels.

[11:06] I'm gonna show you two simple examples.

[11:09] Listen to this nice melodic house track.

[11:14] And we are going into a breakdown.

[11:17] Our classic progression, the bass progression is like this.

[11:21] Harmonic level means the holding to a note that shouldn't be hold on to.

[11:26] The idea is simple.

[11:27] What if we don't resolve to C sharp and hold on to.

[11:30] It's not a resonance but it's like some kind of tension that really really wants to resolve.

[11:36] How you do that?

[11:36] Just extend this loop right before the breakdown comes in.

[11:39] And listen how tension builds up there.

[11:50] There are many ways to use harmonic levels but holding on to the unstable notes is one of the easiest way.

[11:56] The other simple method is actually creating a single note strings.

[12:01] This is utilized a lot in classic music to create this kind of tension and building upon it.

[12:06] 

[12:11] Remember during breakdown we don't want to use so many things to emphasize the vocal part.

[12:15] We are in G sharp minor so what I'm holding to G sharp and D sharp.

[12:19] This is creating this sound.

[12:24] Right?

[12:24] A beautiful sound.

[12:26] Together with a string.

[12:30] It doesn't resolve to anything it just goes like this.

[12:34] And this together with the vocal.

[12:42] It's beautiful.

[12:51] And when the chord progression comes in back it's just beautiful.

[12:54] There are so many harmonic levels but I'm gonna keep it short here.

[12:57] And finally effects levers.

[12:59] And this right here is the one of the biggest mistake if not the biggest mistake that intermediate and beginner producers do.

[13:07] They use effects only to create tension in their tracks.

[13:11] And it creates fake tension.

[13:13] The tension is not there.

[13:14] There are just like additive elements tilting the frequency without really creating a tension itself.

[13:19] Effects levers are uplifters.

[13:23] Or this.

[13:26] So they will tilt to the higher frequencies.

[13:30] Hands uplifters or pitch lifters.

[13:33] The pitch will go up.

[13:36] Snare rolls.

[13:39] Reverse simple reverse voices.

[13:41] I have nothing against using them in a track.

[13:44] But I have everything against them if these are your only tension levers.

[13:49] These are auxiliary elements.

[13:52] The tension should create it somewhere else and these should support.

[13:56] Intermediate track would sound like this.

[14:06] Do you hear?

[14:07] I'm pretty sure if you are a beginner you will be questioning like what is wrong with that.

[14:12] I did myself too.

[14:13] The problem is we have this effects element creating tension but nothing.

[14:18] I'm telling you nothing in the rest of the track reacts to that change in the tension.

[14:25] Hence these emotions from the frequency response or like a sound of your track.

[14:31] The right way of whatever doing like we told before like maybe cutting the high end.

[14:35] Cutting the low end.

[14:36] Tilting the EQ.

[14:37] Adding extra jumps to your bass.

[14:39] Opening cutoff of your synthesizer.

[14:42] Maybe syncopate in the middle.

[14:43] There are so many things that you can do.

[14:45] But this.

[14:46] Don't do this.

[14:47] But if you want to learn more about music production like the way pros do I have more videos over here.

[14:53] Don't worry about it.

[14:53] I will hold your hand and show you everything I know.

[14:56] I promise.
