    "text": "In a second, you will listen the same loop, but with a different tension lever. Can you spot the difference in the energy? There is one skill that separates top one person producers from everybody else. It is not sound design, it's not mixing, it's not mastering. It is the secret to create energy and controlling the energy in their arrangements. Later in this video, I will also show off the number one biggest mistake most intermediate and beginner producers make too. Hint, it's about fake tension. This might be my most valuable video yet, so hop in. Tension levers are tools that help you change the energy levels in your track. They will come in many forms, but we will go each one of them. The first one is called dance the levers. The idea is simple, if we increase the density of information, we will feel the urgency. The simplest example is percussion density. Listen to this. Classic 4 to the floor beat. The simplest way to increase the energy would be actually changing how dense the percussion rhythm is. Now, let's play a 16th note and hear a difference. Low density. High density. Immediate jump in an energy. This is what I call beat density, and easiest way to implement in your tracks, but it doesn't only applies to the percussions. The second dance lever is syncopation. We could syncopate this melody, increase the density and increase the energy. So all the red notes is syncopation, increasing the density of the note hits. How to use this? You can use this around turnarounds, to change the energy from one part of your track to the next part of your track. Listen. Let's build up. So simple, yet so elegant. Dance the levers is not only about adding, but it could be removing too. Listen to this. How can we remove and make it more dense?  Gates can add rhythm by removing some parts of the track. Let's take a look at this infiltrator. It is basically creating three hits from a sustained sound in case it's our vocal. Listen. From here. If you can add a bit of air, and a bit echo, so there are a couple of hits on the sides, ping pong, and a bit shimmery reverb, afterwards you will end up even more energy like this. Now listen how much this elevates the energy of track without adding anything. From here. Cool, isn't it? While we are at gates, the LFOs, those are cool, those can work very similar. Listen to this. Cool, but what if we wanted to increase the energy? What could be done? Simple, LFOs. LFOs are basically tools to apply certain waveform into selected parameters. In this case, if we take the same LFO and apply it on the cutoff filter, we will end up with this. With the 8. And the rate will define how often we replay the wave modulation, right? You see? From here. To here. We can still keep it off-beat feel, creating this slight ducking effect with the kick. Without. With. And now, listen how much that changes the energy of the track. From here. To here. These are dance the levers. If you are enjoying the video, please consider like and subscribe, and I promise, I will make more videos like this for you. So time to go to next one, which is color levers. The levers are so hard word, oh my god. The color tilt means density of frequency in different bands. The track that is dancer here will be more energetic than the track that is dancer on the left side. How can you use that? First example, color tilting your build-ups. This is a track that I've worked with Andrea, and will be released very soon. To be fair, energy is very high already. But I want more. Because when I play this track in the club, I know how people reacts when things go up and up and up. And energy goes up and up and up. And you build this huge expectation. Remember that tilt EQ? All you need to do, get it around, somewhere around here that you like. It doesn't really matter that much where exactly you put it. And what you do, just automate the gain. So it tilts more and more and more when it's going up. Basically shifting the frequency response of your song. Let me A B so you can hear how much difference it makes. Without. With.  Don't tell me that drop was hype. This track is coming in a month, so let me know if you want more tutorials about it. EQs are cool, but you don't need to always use them to tilt the frequency balance. Cymbals, and using cymbals as lever can be very handy. Listen to this. That drop was terrible. Because it lacked energy. What if we take a simple cry sound. And build energy with cymbal hit. Like this. And drop into another cymbal. Filling up to super high, so tilting the frequency response. Anything would work. I love rides. I am a drummer. I played in rock bands. That ride thing is my thing, okay? We have this. It's more like splashy ride, but it doesn't matter. This is really very high sound, right? Very concentrated on the high end. So we are tilting the frequency response. And together now we have this. Without. That's a huge energy difference, but it's just single element. That also gives the groove to the track. It's a real hack. But sometimes you don't want to use crash. Another lever is actually using white noise as a high end tool. How do you do that? Let's take a white noise. I am using Serum's noise generator. The problem is the white noise is not that white. What we do? Like we learned. Tilt it. Now it is much more whiter and brighter. You can literally see we change the slope of the white noise. Add duck to emphasize the groove. So that it's not just like simple noise on top. And a bit shimmer reverb so we can feel the room or the hole too. And let's remove that cymbal and try the same thing with noise. Without. With. Cool. Color levers are cool, but you can be a bit more avant-garde and use pitch levers. Humans feel anxious or feel urgency when the pitch of the things goes up. Love this animation. You can abuse this in your tracks and use to create tension and energy. The simplest way to do this would actually octave jumping your melody. This is a tutorial from two weeks ago. If you haven't seen it, check it out. It's about different moods and modes of techno. It's a very cool video. We have this melody. If you shift this melody one octave up, it will feel more dramatic. You can use this as your advantage between different verses of your track. To create a drama, create tension. Listen to this. Drama.  Change. Immediate tension. Even though the trick is super simple. This can apply to vocals too. Listen to these vocals. We are at the breakdown. We are trying to build energy. This is the changeover. Coming to the final part of the build up. Of course, everything else is changing the drama, but the vocals need to add the drama too. Now, there is another take. Just use the perfect fifth often times back. Raising the pitch a little bit in certain phrases. Goes like this. And this adds to the drama of the vocal. And listen how immediate drama adds in when the second vocal's pitched up comes in. Cool, isn't it? But vocals are maybe not your thing. You can do this even in your basses with your passing notes. This is just offbeat bassline with a groove. Boris Brejcha would approve this groove. By the way, all these things are on my Patreon. I give these to my Patreon followers so that they can download and play around. And this groove alone, I think, worth to join my Patreon. But you decide. The simplest way to create tension and change around points like here. Here we have two bars. Another two bars would be actually giving bass to octave jumps. Here we are in E0. We are jumping E1. And in the second or at the end of four bar, we are actually jumping twice. E1 first, E2 afterwards. So it will be like this. And then. This is called passing notes because they are just right before the passing to the new bar. And they are very short often times. It's a tiny trick but can really add a lot to your track. Listen here now. Super cool. There is also a method of utilizing harmonies and playing around the notes to create tension. These are called harmonic levels. I'm gonna show you two simple examples. Listen to this nice melodic house track. And we are going into a breakdown. Our classic progression, the bass progression is like this. Harmonic level means the holding to a note that shouldn't be hold on to. The idea is simple. What if we don't resolve to C sharp and hold on to. It's not a resonance but it's like some kind of tension that really really wants to resolve. How you do that? Just extend this loop right before the breakdown comes in. And listen how tension builds up there. There are many ways to use harmonic levels but holding on to the unstable notes is one of the easiest way. The other simple method is actually creating a single note strings. This is utilized a lot in classic music to create this kind of tension and building upon it.  Remember during breakdown we don't want to use so many things to emphasize the vocal part. We are in G sharp minor so what I'm holding to G sharp and D sharp. This is creating this sound. Right? A beautiful sound. Together with a string. It doesn't resolve to anything it just goes like this. And this together with the vocal. It's beautiful. And when the chord progression comes in back it's just beautiful. There are so many harmonic levels but I'm gonna keep it short here. And finally effects levers. And this right here is the one of the biggest mistake if not the biggest mistake that intermediate and beginner producers do. They use effects only to create tension in their tracks. And it creates fake tension. The tension is not there. There are just like additive elements tilting the frequency without really creating a tension itself. Effects levers are uplifters. Or this. So they will tilt to the higher frequencies. Hands uplifters or pitch lifters. The pitch will go up. Snare rolls. Reverse simple reverse voices. I have nothing against using them in a track. But I have everything against them if these are your only tension levers. These are auxiliary elements. The tension should create it somewhere else and these should support. Intermediate track would sound like this. Do you hear? I'm pretty sure if you are a beginner you will be questioning like what is wrong with that. I did myself too. The problem is we have this effects element creating tension but nothing. I'm telling you nothing in the rest of the track reacts to that change in the tension. Hence these emotions from the frequency response or like a sound of your track. The right way of whatever doing like we told before like maybe cutting the high end. Cutting the low end. Tilting the EQ. Adding extra jumps to your bass. Opening cutoff of your synthesizer. Maybe syncopate in the middle. There are so many things that you can do. But this. Don't do this. But if you want to learn more about music production like the way pros do I have more videos over here. Don't worry about it. I will hold your hand and show you everything I know. I promise.",
