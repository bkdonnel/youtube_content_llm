    "text": "The black friday is almost here and you want to know what to buy and what to skip, this is a classic in this channel, a black friday plugin tier list, to help exactly with that, I have simple three rules, quality, discount amount and discount frequency, but in the end my personal opinions will decide which tier plugins get, and you may disagree, last year we had beautiful discussions, many commented on the opinions, their own S tier plugins and discounts, so I really encourage you to share your opinions below on the comment section, it is still early in black friday so I will miss probably some plugin deals, so I would also appreciate putting those on the comment section so other people can see, enough with the words, so let's jump in and roll some plugins. I did my homework, we have a lot to go through, and the first one on the list is all this spicy, and a deal they have on their website is buy two get two plugins, on top of that they have individual plugin discounts too, for example I like their situations, we see that they have somewhere between like 50, 60, 40, 30 depending on the plugin itself, discounts looks alright, combining with two to four, I think we are getting good prices, the only issue is that initial prices are quite high, 50% discount makes them still around like 100 euros, so it's still kind of expensive, so because of that I'm gonna put them into like a late A tier, again I don't have any problems with their quality, good sounding plugins, the price is starting to be too high, but discounts are not bad, oh yeah, autotune, if you have been following my channels I have a war against the pricing of the autotune plugins, be it Melodyne or Antares autotune, you may wonder what I mean by that, black friday, early bird, special deals up to 60% off, sounds great, and the one that many people will use, this one, autotune unlimited subscription, so their flagship autotune plugin, it is great, I use it all the time, if you now go to subscribe, 145 danish crowns per month, with 60% discount, so this is the discounted price for the subscription, and I have no idea why I'm getting Danish crowns, hello I'm in Sweden, around 20 euros, with 60% discount, I repeat 20 euros monthly with 60% discount, for me these prices are, I don't know, it's crazy, it's just autotune plugin, like I know there you get other things, but come again, we are really going for the autotune main with this plugin, so you are paying 20 euros per month for just autotune plugin, so yearly 240 euros, yearly, 240 euros, in two years you're almost paying as much as you paid for the Ableton, it is ridiculous, I don't have anything about the quality, but this is really ripping the customer off, so I'm really pissed off, because of that, Melodyne is the same, I'm gonna put it like B, even after 60% you are still paying insane amount of money, so I protest, the next one is actually relatively easier, Arturia effects bundle, currently Arturia have 50% discount with their effects bundle, I use many things here, I think they all sound great, you are getting how many, so many, oh wait 18 here, another 20 here, I don't know, let's be honest, this already covers most of your effects needs, and for 259, you are getting like 10 euros per plugin right, I think it's a straightforward for me, simple as tear, Sonarworks come up with this really cool product, sound ID, voice ID, it translates your voice or anything really into your vocals or different instruments as well, you get to choose from different factory presets, I think Maya sounds good, and to make it really obvious, I'm gonna record my own voice now, so Maya now re-sings it for me, Maya will save my treble vocals, cool isn't it, other cool thing that you can do, record anything that you like, convert it to an instrument, maybe a drum, found some supplies, lift me up, make me feel like I'm the only one, this vocal needs a bit from here, lift me up to here, lift me up, make me feel like I'm the only one, and if you want to try it, check the links below, this also brings us the Arturia V collection, again have 50% discount, this time it's 340, look at this, this is just insane, like how many different synthesizers that you are getting, for me it's a no-brainer, it's one of those plugin bundles that you buy once and use for many years, the good thing is that you even get a better price if you own an Arturia plugin, good job Arturia, I appreciate what you are doing for the community, the next one is Pro Tools, and they say up to 40% off, they have different tiers, again yearly 353 is normally a cheap product, I think it's still a bit on the higher, more expensive end of the things, do I like Pro Tools and Workflow? I personally don't, but that doesn't matter because everybody is different, it will still be around like A, because it's a good discount regardless, the next is Baby Audio, they have different sales for different products, I really like this one actually, it's like a vocoder, vocal transformer, tuner, 50%, it's a nice discount, complete bundle, around 250 euros from 300, alright discount, individual products get discounted even more, but for example even for the humanoid, even I really like them, I think 660 euro is not that cheap, I will because of that like a go for late A tier, early B tier, somewhere around here right, it's alright, they are good sounding products too, that's the important part, the next one on the list is Captain Plugins, I will evaluate the mixing key separately, so now we are talking about more like Captain Plugins Epic, they have around 50%, it's like 40 euros, tools to generate beat, melody, chorus, it's very useful tool, especially if you need a bit more help with your theory, it really helps to go, good price, I'm gonna put it on the B, very early B, but it could be very well A too, the next one on the list, something that I never used myself, but I heard positive things about it from other producers, so take this one with a grain of salt, they have Cradle Everything Bundle and Beyond Super Analog, the one that I often hear positive things is actually the Gut Particle, originally it cost around 119, currently 83 dollars, EQ Plugin together 142 and Everything Bundle 427, now this is expensive isn't it, for the amount of things that you are getting, be free to comment below and what you think about discount, but I assume they don't go too much on the discount, but the discount itself is not that big, plugins itself starts also relatively high price, so I will probably assume like high A, early B, somewhere around here, let me take a sip of my coffee, the next one on the list is D16, the first thing I appreciate when you come into your website, it is very obvious what they are doing, 50% everything, simple, good job D16, I appreciate that you make it super clean for us, I think their plugins sound great, let's see how many total bundle 259, how many plugins do you get, alright, quite a bit, all their effects is all their synthesizers, 249, it is a good deal, because you get a bit more with the Arturia, I'm gonna compare to that, for me this is a almost a S tier, but simply because competition is very high, I'm gonna put it in very early A tier, this one, the Deniz Audio, thank you Deniz, making it clear, 50% for their total bundle, the first time I used them was the Perfect Plate, it was a great sounding plate, Reverb, how many, 4, 12, 14 different plugins with the bundle, 419, I think that's pretty good, because of that I'm gonna give them, right after D16 here, good price, Devious Machines, they are the maker of one of my favorite plugin, Infiltrator, and they have 20% of each plugins, and their bundle as well, 45% looks to be, so 25% is not that much for a Black Friday sale, I know we are kind of a bit spoiled, with all this 40, 50, 60% discounts, however their plugins don't go to discount that often, and moreover good sounding plugins, so early B, just because 25% could be still 30, but, but, but, but, I have to put something here too, right, Eventide, they are the OG FX producers, both for the hardware and software, and I personally enjoy their plugins quite a lot, there are a couple of plugins that I think they are very unique, like their Split EQ, now when I click, I don't see any discount, but I know they do have Black Friday, let's go to plugins, here we go, Newfangled Audio, up to 60%, they sound great as well, Signature FX, 80%, 89, Super Classics, the Black Hole 440, all these classics are very cheap, I will say, and you can bundle them for 200, this is a really good deal, and subscription, and look at this, like you can get subscription for Eventide plugins, you get so many different things for 20 dollars, and Antares, 60% discount, 20 euro, even more expensive than this, that's what I'm saying, my rage against these autotune plugin providers won't end, okay, where do we put this, I'm not even sure if this is a Black Friday deals or just deals, I think overall you can easily put it in the late A, the next one is FL Studio, oh my, FL Studio has 30% discount, the one thing about FL Studio is you buy it once, and you get lifetime upgrades, workflow is not for me, but it doesn't mean that other people enjoy this type of workflow, I'm gonna put them actually in the S tier because of that, the next one is GeForce, and it says up to 55%, they are known for their emulations, 9 different synthesizers I suppose, nothing against their sound, but the price wise, more than 400, so we see here 373, 423 euros for their bundle, so for me unfortunately the price is way too high, considering the alternatives that we have in the market, so for me this doesn't make it to S or A tier, so hence we are gonna put it somewhere around here, the next one is Mercurial Tones, of course I have to do my shameless plug here, we have up to 40% discount, if you get one 25, if you get two 40%, you can actually combine any products, I wanted to do this because people like to combine different things into different packs themselves, so I want to give them freedom, if you haven't tried, if you are looking for samples and preset packs, these are my samples and preset packs, and even courses are here, I have different course depending on what you are looking for, so if you are looking to buy anything from me, this is for your time to try them out, and of course my very unbiased opinion, Mercurial Tones, S tier, very unbiased opinion, very objective, next on the list is Sound Theory, let me come clean, Crafter is my favorite clipper, I always say it, it is genius, I think it sounds great, I think the price is a bit high, and I don't think it's too much for giving what you get, 1000 crowns like 90, 95 euros, now it's 45 euros, which is actually pretty good for this, and then Gullfoss from 118, 90 euros to 90 euros probably, overall 50% discount on both, it's great, the starting price is a bit high, not that great, so you know what's coming, go to A tier, somewhere around here, good stuff, next one is IK Multimedia, I will say this is mostly for the players, like guitar players and so on, you get everything for 50 euros or go max for 100 euros, here we go, around 300 to 100 euros, it's a pretty good overall, I think overall good deal, so maybe high on here, if you are looking for that type of plugins, I think it's a good option, the next one is one of my favorite, Izotope has 60% off, just let me come clean, I love almost everything they do, like I use Ozone all the time, I use Neutron separate plugins all the time, I use Nektar all the time, I use everything from them, I think their interfaces are great, I think their plugins sound really good, and I recommend them to my audience because of that too, you have to log in to see your prices, there will be 40% discount on Izotope products bundles, if you're new customers and if you're existing customers, you will get 50 or 60% depending on what you have, and this is like easy as for me, Kilo Hearts, another company that's close to my heart because they are from Sweden, but not only that, I really like the things they often do, they will have a lot of free bundle for producers, I think it's great for community, we are going to split this into two, first Kilo Hearts bundle and then the Phase Plant discount, for the Phase Plant simple original price 200, new price 100, Phase Plant has to be best thing when it comes to modulating everything, give it that it's not maybe as easy as pigments and serum, but modulation options actually go beyond pigments and serum, almost a modular synthesizer in subtractive synthesizer package kind of, so I love it and put Phase Plant very early 8, and the Kilo Hearts bundle, you get the bundle for 300, I think it's still alright price because you get so many plugins, just let me show you how it looks when you install their bundle, so many things I don't even know, 300 I think still good price, 25% is low on the discount side, so I'm gonna put it early, simply because of that, but I like what they do, I think they are great company, great sound effects, great sound and scene, alright next one, Claveground, another Swedish company, another close to heart, overall I really like their design minimalist language, even though this look crazy, look how pretty is this one, however when it comes to Black Friday, I don't find much information about their website, they have a free plugin UMA, it's good, but it's not what we are looking for, that being said if we go to plugin boutique, you actually see they have in between 40 to like 60-70% depending on what you are getting, I think they could have done this on their website already, like Core Presser, this was very popular, core means sausage in Swedish, so sausage presser, okay what do we do, discount amount is really good and the price are okay, late is I think better fit to this one, the next one is Knock, another content creator plugin, if you don't know, it is Decap's plugin, I never used it, but I understand the appeal of the plugin and the main reviews of the plugin is also pretty good too, so whatever I say please take it with a pinch of salt, initial price is 150, I think for a plugin that does what Knock does a bit too much, however the discount itself is quite a bit, so it comes down all the way to 69, which makes it much more reasonable and because of that I'm going to put it like late A, the next one is Native Instruments, they already have the cyber sale active, which means that you get 50% off with the complete and even 50% for the upgrade prices as well, and because of that I'm going to be again generous and give them an S tier, I don't have any professional producer friend who doesn't own complete, Korg, Korg special price, the plugin bundle, many people I think looking for this to from 399 to 299, so we are having around 25% discount and amounts that synthesizers that you are getting kind of similar to R3 a bit less, 299 all right price 25% discount, I'm gonna put it like a mid A tier, I still like their synthesizers and emulations, so if I'm looking for a buying opportunity, this is probably the best time you can get it, oh I had the craftor separately here, you know what, because I love this plugin so much, go straight S tier, one of the most important for a producer is being able to trust what they hear and many times either the headphones or the room itself has an immense effect on what we really hear, a solution to this issue is sound ID, you can use sound ID as a plugin in your DAW or as a whole on your system and what it does, it corrects your speakers or your headphones so that you are less affected of room modes or frequency response of your headphone, for the headphones it is simple, you select the headphones that you have, in this case DT 770 Pro and we see this is actually a frequency response of my headphones, when you turn on the calibration, sound ID changes the curves to make it as flat as possible, for the room you can do exactly the same thing but with a microphone that comes with your sound ID, sound ID reference has 50% discount on Black Friday, so this is your perfect time to try it out, links in the description below, Lander, Lander has 50% off which is great and I actually kind of one of these person that I like their plugins and they have also this thing like you can get their AI masters and you can and they also like it's kind of supplies loop cloud alternative, they have their own version of that too and they have distribution too, so they have a lot of things all together, come bundles and like courses and everything and they have the partners too and you get all this, you really get a lot of things to be honest, look at this, you get Arturia plugins too, BayBaud here, this is actually kind of great isn't it, look at this, you get so many things, you get GeForce access too, three pitches here, well I think that makes it pretty obvious, the price right, the price is still quite okay, so 120 crowns per month, 10 euros per month, all these things, I'm debating if it's S tier or A tier, but I'm gonna go for the like very early A tier here, but one can argue putting on S tier too, because kind of similar to complete in a sense, not that complete, but yeah kind of, the next one is Malda production, now this is one company that has really fans online, for good reason, their free plugins are really good and you feel that initial connection to them, because you probably use one or more free plugins from them, and when it comes to the deals that have, they say up to 91% discount, but again it depends a little bit how we define the discount, so the most important thing probably we are looking for their bundle, let me try to find their bundles, bundles is here, this one is around 150 euros, complete bundle is around, that is expensive, around like a thousand euros, then they've created a bundle 35 plugin, this is a bit more in line, total fx is, dang I didn't know they were that expensive, what is this, turbo bundle 25, this is more reasonable, 85% off, they are great plugins, but the price is a bit still steep for a producer, I understand there are so many plugins and probably all of them are very useful, I don't know what to say, probably like, okay let's put it here, but I may argue here, because again for me the initial price as much as the final price is important, thousand euros a big commitment, I understand for a pro producers it's still worth probably, but many of the people who are buying these plugins are hobby producers and spend thousand euros even on discount for plugin bundles, it's a little bit too much, the next one is the mix in key, this is one of these niche product, it helps you to look at the tracks and try to figure out, try to figure out the energy of a track, the key of the track, bpm of the track, and you can even build your cues on the track, then as a dj just take that and then use it, and in the newer version it even finds the tracks that fits to the energy and the key and so on, so help you with your mixing, so it's a very useful tool for djs, mixing key pro 50% off, you are getting it like 43 euros, 42 euros, somewhere around here, extremely cheap for what you are getting, so this mix, this is the reason I wanted to put it separately, again it's a very niche product, if you are not dj this doesn't make sense to you, but for me this is a no-brainer, so S tier, the next one output, up to 50% off, output has to be one of the first companies that really nailed the user interface, with coming with like this modern, easy to use, fun interface with the good quality effects and products, they placed themselves more in the premium segment, hence the relatively higher prices, but on the other hand, if you for example take a look at effects bundle, you get thermal, portal, movement, beyond, current, these are I think presets for 199, it's actually kind of good deal for the things that you are getting, like thermal is really good, I like portal, I like movement too, even the same thing with the instruments, so I'm going to give them a solid A here, somewhere around here right, if it's not your first time here, you know my love to pigments, amazing synthesizer, very visual, sounds perfect for me, I'll leave it 50% straight to the S tier, now plug-in boutique, plug-in boutique always comes up with this bundle on the black friday, with tons of different VSTs, and from all of the different companies too, like this year they have this 69 dollars, who picked this, anyways price, for a premium value of almost 2000 dollars, from neon reverb is here, contour is here, to all of the good things, we have production outlaw, I don't know this one, looks good thing, like the list still goes on, axis from geforce 2, VX saturator, another good one, the list goes on and on, good deal for the price, good job plug-in my favorite 99, polyverse bundle 299 from 694, again the starting price is a bit too high, even though the plug-in is really good, that I use all the time, but the discount is nice too, so like but it's fine, another one close to heart, reason studios, it is impressive, because full license is 200 euros from 500, this is actually pretty good, upgrade 75, adds on 90% off, and reason plus impressive, 99 per year, pretty cheap, I will give it to them, and again this is kind of a niche thing, like if you enjoy reason as a DAW, so I'm gonna put them to the S, simply because how much discount they made available, good job, the next one is Rhodes, another niche products, discounts are pretty good too, from 274 to 100 here, and the ontology that they have different things, 159 to at least A, some may argue it could be even S, because the deals are good, so it depends a bit on you, Roland, okay they don't have the epilogue black friday yet, all right, no Roland, next, safari pedals, so the pedals are mostly guitarist thing, but I find them very useful for any type of production, I like them especially for the sound design too, and the safari pedals, first they look great, secondly they sound cool, thirdly they are often very cheap, for what you get, and this year they up 90% off they say, so everything bundle is 159, what do you get, five dollars or euros, what is this, five dollars per pedal, easy one, I could easily put it in S, but again it's a bit slightly niche, not maybe everybody's liking it, so I'm going to put the very early A, because of that, the next one is scaler, cool tool for creating chord progressions, or harmonies, or melodies, they have different modules inside scaler, and it's pretty useful, they have 30% off, discounted price 69, is I think very fair for what you are getting, 30% I think it deserves a like a mid-ground A tier, the next one is the shaper box, the last year when I commented on this, some people get mad at me, for the main reason, and this year I see the same, if you take a look at their website, you will see that 379 to 89, amazing, it is amazing, it's an amazing tool I use all the time, the problem is their actually regular price, outside black friday's, I think last year it was 99, so in reality the extra discount is around 10 dollars, this makes it very complicated, because I always compare the price before black friday, or like regular price, hence it will be only be able to go to like really late B tier, because of that, you have bigger opportunity cost with the shaper box, considered it like let's say Arturia, where you get 50% discount for real, all right the next one is Softube, there are so many Swedish companies in the plugin space I realize, they have this kind of like every week you get another deal, and then you get the black friday, you get the big deal, it's hard to judge from the discount, but the discount you will get at that, at the moment you have like a extra 50% with the code, on top of the discounts that exist in, for example if you buy the amplifier, which is this is a really good price by the way, and apply this one, you will get another 15%, so interior you can get it like what is it 39 here, and you apply this, I suppose yeah it does, it does another 15 on top, it works, so we only get this like a 30 euros, which is a really good deal, I don't know if I have this one, but I probably want to get this one after this right, so the deals are limited, but the deals are kind of really good, like I bought like this one, like this one, and if you get their newsletters, you can get another 25%, so very limited discount, bad, but good discounts for the things that you have, good, and like I think it's a bit like somewhere around here, maybe around here, sonible has a big discount in individual products, like smart eq is like 129 to 49, smart eq is if you don't know, like ai help eq, that helps you many extras too, and then you have smart essential 99, smart bundle, where you get seven different plugins, and you save 40%, and the price is 149 euros, again I'm gonna be here early as well, uh sonnox, so if you don't know, I had a, I'm gonna put it here, so you can watch, I had effects tier list for plugins, sonnox was actually F tier, because the moment that I was checking, the plugin costed like 249 for a limiter, or let's put it this way, there are other maximizer limiters that sounds is good for much better price, so I roasted them pretty hard in that video for the prices, and guess what happened, but like Friday happened, look at the prices now, 39 to 95, 69, somebody's listening, and now prices are much more in reasonable, here we go 279, you see the price, nobody's paying that, now the prices are much more reasonable, overall, even though some of them are still expensive, like if you think reverb 140, up to 140, some of guys I think still a bit in the expensive side, by the way this is good, I hope they continue this way, to make the plugins more modern, to user-friendly to use, so I think I'm gonna put them like a very early B, it's possible to put it A2, not here, here, sonnox, I did, did, Sony, put it here, universal audio, this was two years ago, I roasted them very hard, for the same problem, single plugin 250 euros, nobody's paying that, doesn't matter how it sounds, because there are really good alternatives out there, and the difference between the good alternative and the VAD is not a good justification of for paying like 200, 300 more, as simple as that, but they did after that, two years passed, and now their prices are come down much, much more reasonable levels, I guess this is what market does, people stop buying your stuff, if you put ridiculous prices, they have a couple of different things, they have this like pick 10 plugins for 99, from 50 different plugins, so it's not their whole plugin bundle, but you can pick like from 50 different plugins, 10 of your favorite for 100 euros, I think it's good, good job, well done, some of them sometimes goes for free, some of them you may already have for free, but some of them maybe you don't, it's good, this is the UAD custom one, I think yeah, this one is the choose from 160 UAD, pick three, get three, 196 plugins, 180 euros, 30 euros per plugin, very reasonable price for the quality that you get, UAD plugins sometimes sound very good, and you know what, this time, two years ago, they were F, this time they are very high, early A, the next one is Vocaline, you will see this theme going on and on again, and Vocaline is one of those that I always complain, I work a lot with the vocals lately, for past two years, and that means that I have tons of different captures, and I have to really align them every single time, and I hate it, and I hate it, because it takes too much time, it's a very boring non-creative work, that I don't really appreciate, and Vocaline fixes that, now the price wise 200 euros or dollars, is of course not cheap, but the amount of time I'm saving for myself, is extremely important, so my take, if you are like me, with the producers, who works with the vocals a lot, and value your time, get this plugin, if your producers doesn't work with the vocals, or vocals that you are using from Splice, or Loopcloud, everything is already fixed, you don't know in this, if you let me, I would actually put an S tier, because I'll use it that much, but I also understand it's a very niche thing again, so I'm gonna put it in A tier, the next one on the list is Waves, I many times commented Waves marketing strategy, and I find it very non-ethical, being that putting the price is very high, and giving like 90% discounts, and then sometimes you get a product, and you have to pay for compatibility after some years, you are forced to buy the new version of the product that you have, I don't like that type of marketing strategy, that being said, Black Friday offers you get like 93 plugins for 200, in a sense that's a good option, but yet again, like I said, these are very old plugins, that are in my own personal view, sounding not as good as the plugins that we have currently on the market, with let's say Softube, or UAD, and so on right, so I would rather prefer use these tools over Waves, I'm gonna give them still kind of a very late A, but I would also tell you, but I would still suggest you to read at least a bit reviews for the users, and their experiences, at least past one, two years, so you know the current state of Waves, the next one XLN Audio, and people know it from the RC-20, it's one of these plugins, that does one thing really good, and because of that, it became kind of a like a go-to plugin for many producers, for certain type of feeling, I think XO is another tool, that a lot of people really like, there is the RC-20 and XO bundle for 54 of, in Plugin Boutique, so I would assume, they will probably have something like this, in their website as well, this too for 100, yeah, I mean all right, I guess, so I'm gonna put like mid B tier, because of that, and that concludes our tier list, again I probably missed some, and there will be probably more plugin deals coming soon, so I really recommend you to share your opinions, like your own S tier maybe deal, so that other people know, if I missed it, and or the other things, that you disagree with the plugins that I told, and one thing I want to know, if you want me to do also hardware Black Friday deals too, I know a lot of people looking forward to that, but I never done that, so I don't know if my community wants that, if you do, let me know on the comments, all right that's it.",
