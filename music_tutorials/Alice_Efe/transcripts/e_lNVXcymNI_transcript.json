    "text": "just close your eyes this is the single and most confident yet distracted piece of advice in the music community today use your ears it sounds romantic it sounds artistic but if you are producing in a home studio in 2026 trusting your ears for the low end is not artistic it is gamble and the house your room acoustics always wins today i'm going to show you how your ears are lying to you and how to finally see the truth let's start with the hard reality you are likely mixing in a room built for sleeping not for music production top left what producers think what they hear top right the bedroom look at that huge dip around 40 hertz here is our living room a total chaos and another reference headphone look at that deep physics is literally canceling that frequency out in your listening position you can't hear the kick drums punch so you're boosted with your eq to your ears it finally sounds full but in reality you just ruined your mix it's going to sound muddy everywhere else you didn't fail as a producer your room guest lighted you but let's say you have a perfect room you spend 10 000 on treatment but you are still fighting the final boss your own biology human evolution design our ears to hear voices snapping physics and babies crying these mid-range frequencies in that range your hearing is precise like a fine-tipped artist's brush but down here below 100 hertz we lose definition we lose pitch perception relying on your ears for sub base detail is like trying to hyper-realistic portrait using a paint roller you are making broad clumsy strokes thinking you are being precise you aren't you physically cannot hear the fine lines but the analyzer it kind of sees everything so how do we fix this we stop kissing and start looking here are three scenarios where your eyeballs win over your ears every time lalala introduced a new algorithm that's called Andromeda so the newest neural network delivers cleaner vocal isolation if you are like me who really loves especially taking the vocals from old classics this is really heaven sent tool so go to lalala i'm going to use one of my own tracks you upload the track and bam you get the vocals and track take a listen to vocal listen to the original vocals and see how close it got even with the effects let's take a look at for a bit busier area of the track figure out figure out isn't this crazy and that part of the track is really busy you click on split in full and bam now you can download the full separated vocals and instrumental let's try one more time and separate it more time this is a good example because it also shows it still does really good job even though there's a heavy vocal auto-tune on top if you want to try it yourself check the links below invisible phase issue you layer your kick and sub it sounds weak you try to eq it you try to compress it it sounds still it lacks the punch stop touching the faders and eq look at the waveform see this constructive interference versus destructive interference your kick wants to push the speaker out however your sub wants to pull it in they cancel each other out look at this roll off your sub removing your punch let's get the peaks aligned here here here and look at that punch it hits here i talk this a lot in the channel it is a 30 hertz cut mid there's so many different issues that arise because of this you have been told cut everything below 30 hertz to clean up the headroom right look at the transient of this kick let's put an eq cut that 30 hertz and look at that again this is called phase shift by cutting the lows we actually smeared the transient energy you thought you were cleaning up the mud you end up smearing your transient of your kick sometimes effect could be even weirder look at this kick cool punchy look at this fatty initial attack 30 hertz cut look at the results this looks super weird isn't it the whole fatness of the kick is gone and the waveform is even weirder don't cut blind look at the response if the waveform looks weaker it is weak i saved the best for the last this is the most important part the referencing you compare your mix to the pro track and yours feels weak so you turn up the sub by comparing apples to oranges their track is mastered compressed brick yours is dynamic if you want to compare the low end you have to simulate the master crush your track with the limiter first you need to look at two things the dynamic response and sustain response what does that mean put an eq cut it off this is more or less the bass but we are looking the dynamic relationship between the top point and lower point this is the footprint of the track let's look at our track do you see how fast we see the problem how easy it was to figure out we are effectively quieter on the sub bass now go move your sub bass up look at that now these two look much more similar give it two three db plus and minus it is your taste but now super fast you're over on the ballpark i'm not telling you to stop listening your ears are for the soul of the music use your ears for the groove use your ears for the melody use your ears for the camera use your ears for the emotion of the track that is where art lives but for the low end for the foundation that is engineering and in engineering we don't guess we measure use your eyes to build the foundation of your house and use your ears to design and decorate it if you want to see exactly how i set up my monitoring tools and reference my low end take a look at this video i go super deep into the concept will you speech perfect oh my god human evolution design or ears to hem",
