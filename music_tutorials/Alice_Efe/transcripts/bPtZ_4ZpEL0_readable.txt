[00:00] You are here for a ride today. One of these is louder than other. Can you hear it?

[00:16] So how can you make something clearly louder without turning it up? If you are looking at

[00:21] compressors or the volume faders, don't. This is what I call phantom loudness. It is created by

[00:26] adding something your ears can hear, but your meters barely can see. You are watching my series

[00:31] if you can learn one music production trick today, learn this. And today we learn phantom loudness.

[00:37] This is a visualization that I built for you. This illustrates really nice. This is the amount

[00:42] of extra colors that you add with saturation. These are bass, body and lead. The good thing

[00:48] about saturation is you can decide how much you can add. How many extra bubbles there will be

[00:52] inside your jars and instrument. And this add a little bit saturation. Bubbles, extras inside those jars.

[01:00] So what happens? These bubbles, saturation add up. Leading to this much more colorful,

[01:06] fuller jar. Hence the phantom loudness. Listen to this.

[01:16] Gorgeous right? But it lacks a bit of loudness, a bit fullness, a bit depth. And all this can be

[01:21] achieved with single trick. And this is the targeted saturation to achieve the phantom loudness.

[01:27] I'm gonna copy exactly the same loop here. And we're gonna attack each element to create

[01:32] certain enhancement. First, long end. I want to glue bass and kick, but also a bit oomph by adding saturation.

[01:40] I know some people complain that I use a lot of different audio effects plugins, but the reason

[01:43] for this, I really want to show you my own workflow. The things that I use every day. So you don't feel

[01:48] I am hiding information from you okay? For this one, we're gonna go low. Pentode sounds a bit

[01:54] too dirty for low end. So we're gonna bring down the pentode and try out, but keep saturation.

[02:02] Without. With. If you think you're gonna try this, please consider like and subscribe. And I promise

[02:09] I will make more videos like this. And we can always check our peaks. So we keep the same peaks okay?

[02:15] Without. With. If anything, we are actually a bit below the previous peak level. You hear how subtle

[02:23] it is. It doesn't matter. You will see how much difference it will make later. Then we have

[02:27] percussion group. Sounds like this. Now for this one, I'm gonna use roar. So that I can use stereo

[02:34] saturation. Stage one. Stage two. Compress a bit. Let's adjust the levels by output here.

[02:49] For the hats, I really liked this sizzle feel of exciter from Ozone. I'm gonna oversample.

[02:55] This is another reason I use actually on this one on the hats. Retro.

[03:03] And the rest tried.

[03:08] Adjust the peaks.

[03:14] And you have these pads.

[03:19] Only thing that I can think is tape. This wobbly tape sound on top.

[03:30] Without tape. With tape.

[03:33] Yep. Same. Now there is also high bells, but high bells already has a bit pedals on them.

[03:39] So they are quite distortions. Again, we only add the saturation at the places we think it will make

[03:44] difference. Even though it is subtle. And my final take is adding glue saturation on top of everything.

[03:52] We are on the flat saturation. Time to tone down a little bit. Try it. And bring the mix to

[04:01] something like this. So it's a parallel saturation. Adjust the peaks one more time.

[04:07] Without. With.

[04:11] Again, our peaks are actually less than before. Moment of truth.

[04:15] Let's do an A B. And to make sure that we are in the same saturation levels. Original.

[04:23] Saturated. So we see. Saturated. Original. Here how not only the loudness changed,

[04:31] but perceived depth of the track also changed. And things started sound cleaner. And less A B now.

[04:49] The old version almost sounds like claustrophobic, isn't it? If you learn more about mixing,
