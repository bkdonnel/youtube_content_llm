[00:00] But if you had a preset pack dedicated just for the bass, this is exactly what I wanted

[00:05] to know, and made Loom just for that.

[00:08] Loom is a preset pack for Serum 2, it has total of 100 presets, but all of these presets

[00:14] are bass sounds.

[00:16] But I will let the presets talk now because that's why you probably hear.

[00:19] Let's go.

[00:20] Every preset of course comes with a midi, meaning that if you go to clip here, you will

[00:24] see the midi for each preset and that means you can just click play and scroll through

[00:29] the different presets.

[00:33] And of course 8 macros to play around while you are listening.

[01:02] Another one of my favorite.

[01:08] And everything is of course like mix ready, so you can just start, put this in your track

[01:12] and yeah, just use it as it is.

[01:32] Let's go.

[02:16] Really gorgeous.

[02:41] Another one of my favorite as well.

[03:26] What a gorgeous preset, isn't it?

[04:22] Let's go.

[04:44] Another one of my favorite.

[05:02] Let's go.

[05:16] The one thing that I hated in a lot of preset packs is that you don't get this really good

[05:22] sub basses because they are like darker, people don't want to put them because they are not

[05:26] fancy.

[05:26] So I had a category for subs just for that type of subs, the sustain subs, donkey subs,

[05:31] but just subs, good strong subs.

[06:07] Another favorite of mine.

[06:15] I know it's just a sub, but even this could be kind of song starter really.

[06:51] And of course, don't bass is important.

[07:21] And of course, reese basses, these are very important.

[07:52] That's really dirty reese bass.

[08:13] Deep, deep bass and reese.

[08:28] And of course, growl bass is for more faster techno genres oftentimes.

[09:12] Let's go.
